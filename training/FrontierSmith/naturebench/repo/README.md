- **🚀 [2026-06-24] We introduce [NatureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.24530), a benchmark for scientific ML coding agents on Nature-family tasks.**

## 📖Overview

NatureBench is a cross-discipline benchmark of **90 tasks** distilled from peer-reviewed Nature-family publications, spanning **6 scientific domains**, designed to evaluate whether AI coding agents can move beyond reproduction toward discovery. Each task asks an agent to solve a real scientific machine-learning problem and is scored against the source paper's reported state of the art.

NatureBench is built on **NatureGym**, an automated pipeline that converts a published paper into a containerized task package comprising a task brief, the paper's dataset, a held-out test set with hidden ground truth, and an automated evaluator.

## 📊Results

Across twelve coding-agent configurations, the strongest reaches a 15.6% Surpass-SOTA rate, and success remains uneven across the six scientific domains NatureBench spans.

## 🏅Submit Results

We welcome results from researchers and developers who have evaluated models or
agents on NatureBench. Submissions are currently accepted by email; see
[`submit-results/`](submit-results/) for the result templates, validation and
scoring scripts, required raw artifacts, and submission email.

## 🔧Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrontisAI/NatureBench.git
cd NatureBench

conda env create -f conda_env.yml
conda env create -f conda_env_eval.yml
conda activate naturebench
```

This creates two environments: `naturebench` (the main orchestration environment that runs `run_naturebench.py`, agent adapters, Docker scheduling, and result aggregation) and `naturebench-eval` (the evaluation service environment that runs scoring logic).

The base Docker image is built automatically on the first run via `--ensure-base-image` (used in the Quick Start below). To build it manually:

```bash
bash scripts/ensure_naturebench_base.sh
```

## 🚀Quick Start

Set credentials for your agent. Claude Code is shown here; for Codex, Gemini CLI, the post-hoc judge, and network proxy, see [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=...
```

Run end-to-end. This single command downloads the dataset, builds the base image if needed, starts the evaluation service, and evaluates:

```bash
python run_naturebench.py \
  --tasks gpu_low \
  --agent claude \
  --model <model-name> \
  --out-dir ./results/claude_<model-name>_gpu_low \
  --gpu-devices 0,1,2,3 \
  --max-workers 4 \
  --start-eval-services \
  --eval-env-mapping ./eval_env_mapping.json \
  --ensure-base-image
```

This lists only the parameters you set explicitly; options with sensible defaults are omitted (see [Quick Start defaults](docs/usage.md#quick-start-defaults) for the full list and their values). Adjust `--gpu-devices` / `--max-workers` to your hardware. When running without GPUs, omit `--gpu-devices` and any other GPU scheduling options. The complete parameter reference is in [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md).

The built-in `--agent` options are `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`; to run your own agent on NatureBench instead, see [`docs/custom-agents.md`](docs/custom-agents.md).

### Evaluation Setup

For comparability, our reported runs use the following setup:

| Setting | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Per-task timeout | A 4-hour agent solve budget (`--timeout 14400`). |
| Compute | Each `gpu_low` task uses one NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090 (24 GB), each `gpu_high` task uses one NVIDIA A800 (80 GB, A100-class), and the 3 `cpu` tasks use no GPU. Task-group lists are provided in [`task-set/`](task-set/). |
| Web search | Disabled for all evaluated agents. |

## 🌱NatureGym

The task packages are built by **NatureGym**, an automated, Skills-based pipeline that turns a published Nature-family paper into a containerized, runnable task. It filters papers, acquires and verifies the data, and assembles the task package (brief, data, evaluator, environment, metadata), while an information firewall removes the source method so that agents must *discover* solutions rather than reproduce them.

The pipeline runs as a chain of Claude Code skills driven by batch scripts, all under [`naturegym/`](naturegym/). See [`naturegym/README.md`](naturegym/README.md) for the stage-by-stage flow, the construction skills, and how to run them.
