Let me start from what the imputation problem actually is, before reaching for any machinery. I have records, each a vector `x = (x_1, ..., x_d)`, but I only ever see some of the entries. Write `M = (M_1, ..., M_d) ∈ {0,1}^d` for the mask — `M_i = 1` if I observed coordinate `i`, `0` if it's a hole — and let `X̃` be the partial vector, `X̃_i = X_i` where `M_i = 1` and a placeholder `*` where it's missing. I want to fill the holes. The lazy answer is to put each column's mean into its holes, but that throws away the one thing that makes imputation possible at all: the features are correlated, so the observed coordinates of a record tell me a lot about its missing ones. A column mean is the same number for every record; it can't use that.

So what is the *right* thing to recover? Not a single number per hole. The honest object is the conditional distribution `P(X | X̃ = x̃)` — given what I saw, what's the distribution over the complete vector? If I have that, I can draw several different completions of the same record and actually represent how uncertain I am about each hole, which is the whole point of multiple imputation. A method that only gives me the conditional mean pretends each fill is certain and shrinks everything toward an average. I want to *sample* from `P(X | X̃)`.

And there's a brutal constraint hanging over all of this: in a lot of real settings the data is *intrinsically* incomplete — there is no complete version sitting anywhere, not even a clean training set. A patient's biopsy feature was never collected for those patients; I can't go get it. So whatever I build has to learn `P(X | X̃)` from incomplete data itself. This single requirement quietly kills a lot of options before I start.

Let me walk the tools I have and watch each one fail against exactly these two demands — model the *distribution*, and learn from *incomplete* data. Mean imputation: ignores correlations, gives a point, dead on both counts. k-nearest-neighbors (Troyanskaya): for each hole, average over the `k` records most similar on the jointly-observed features — at least it's local and uses correlations, but it's still a conditional-mean estimate, no distribution, and the similarity it relies on rots as more entries go missing. MICE (van Buuren): initialize the holes, then sweep variable by variable, each time regressing that variable on all the others using the current fills and re-drawing its missing entries from the fitted predictive model; cycle a few times. This one is actually generative-flavored — because it *samples* from each conditional it can do multiple imputation — but each conditional is its own little (usually linear) regression, fit independently, so the conditionals needn't be mutually consistent (there may be no joint they all come from), and the linear-ish per-variable models miss nonlinear interactions. MissForest is MICE with a random forest as each per-variable predictor: great on nonlinearities and mixed types, but a forest returns a conditional-*mean* prediction, so back to a point estimate and no native uncertainty. Matrix completion assumes the table is low-rank — a linear-subspace bet that's too rigid for genuinely nonlinear feature relations. EM fits a parametric joint (say a Gaussian) and imputes from its conditionals — but commit to the wrong family and it falls apart, and it falls apart precisely on the mixed continuous/categorical tables I care about. Denoising autoencoders learn a nonlinear encode-decode and read the reconstructed holes off the decoder — flexible, nonlinear, exactly the right expressiveness — except the classic recipe *needs complete data* to train, because it manufactures (corrupted, clean) training pairs by corrupting clean inputs. That's the one thing I said I don't have.

Stepping back, the gap is sharp. The discriminative crowd (kNN, MICE, MissForest, matrix completion) are point predictors that bottom out at a conditional mean — no uncertainty. The generative crowd either bets on a parametric family that breaks on mixed data (EM) or needs complete data (autoencoders). Nobody learns a flexible, nonparametric model of the full `P(X | X̃)` straight from incomplete data. That's the hole I want to fill. The autoencoder is the one that's *almost* right — right expressiveness, wrong training requirement — so what I'm reaching for is its nonlinear function-fitting power but trained in some way that never needs a clean target to copy. The training-without-clean-targets requirement is the unusual one; let me look for a tool built around exactly that.

GANs have exactly that shape. In the GAN framework (Goodfellow et al. 2014), a generator `G` turns noise into samples, a discriminator `D` outputs the probability a sample is real rather than generated, and they play `min_G max_D V(D,G)` with `V = E_{x∼p_data}[log D(x)] + E_{z∼p_z}[log(1−D(G(z)))]`. The pointwise fact that drives it: for fixed `G`, the best `D` is `D*(x) = p_data(x)/(p_data(x)+p_g(x))`, and plugging that back, `G` ends up minimizing `−log 4 + 2·JSD(p_data ∥ p_g)`, which bottoms out exactly at `p_g = p_data`. So an adversarial game, with no clean targets, drives the generated distribution to the true one at its optimum. And the conditional version (Mirza & Osindero 2014) just feeds an auxiliary variable `y` into both `G` and `D`, turning the sampler into a sampler from `P(X | y)` — which is suggestive, because what I want *is* a conditional sampler, conditioned on the observed part `x̃`.

So let me try to build an imputation version of a GAN: `G` takes the partial vector and produces a completed one, `D` is the adversary that keeps `G` honest, no clean data needed, and I'm modeling a distribution rather than a point. But I should not assume the conditional GAN drops in untouched — let me build it piece by piece and watch for where the standard machinery stops fitting.

Start with the generator. It should look at the observed entries and fill the holes. Following the GAN template I'll give it noise too, so it can *sample* different completions, not memorize one. Define `G : X̃ × {0,1}^d × [0,1]^d → X`, and let `Z` be `d`-dimensional noise independent of everything. Now — how much noise? My first instinct is to hand it all of `Z`. But hold on: I'm conditioning on `x̃`, which already pins down every observed coordinate exactly. The thing that's actually random, that I need noise to sample, is only the *missing* coordinates — the target `P(X | X̃)` lives on a space of dimension `‖1 − M‖_1`, the number of holes, not `d`. If I inject full `Z`, I'm feeding randomness into coordinates whose values are already determined, which is just nuisance variance. So I should mask the noise to the holes: pass `(1 − M) ⊙ Z`. Then

  `X̄ = G(X̃, M, (1 − M) ⊙ Z)`

is the generator's output — and I'll let it output a value for *every* coordinate, even observed ones (I'll come back to why that's useful). The actual completed vector keeps the real observed entries and only uses `G` in the holes:

  `X̂ = M ⊙ X̃ + (1 − M) ⊙ X̄`.

`X̂` is what I'll feed downstream and what `D` will judge. Good. That's a clean conditional generator.

Now the discriminator, and here the vanilla GAN setup stops fitting. In a vanilla GAN `D` looks at a whole sample and says "real" or "fake" — one bit for the entire vector. But `X̂` is never wholly real or wholly fake: its observed coordinates are *genuinely real* (they're the true `X̃`), and only the imputed coordinates are synthetic. A single real/fake verdict on the whole vector is the wrong granularity — it would be trivially confused, since every `X̂` is a real/fake blend. What's the sensible adversarial question here? It's *which coordinates* are the fakes. So let `D` output, for each coordinate, the probability that *that* coordinate was actually observed:

  `D : X → [0,1]^d`,  `D(x̂)_i = P(coordinate i was observed)`.

That is, `D` is trying to predict the mask `M` componentwise. And the adversarial pressure is: `G` wants its imputed coordinates to be so good that `D` can't tell them apart from the observed ones — can't reconstruct the mask. That's a much more natural game for this problem. The value function becomes the componentwise cross-entropy of `D` predicting `M`:

  `V(D,G) = E_{X̂,M}[ M^T log D(X̂) + (1 − M)^T log(1 − D(X̂)) ]`,  `min_G max_D V(D,G)`.

with `log` elementwise. Before trusting this, I want to run the GAN optimal-`D` argument on it and see what `G` is really being pushed toward — the whole reason GANs work is that substituting `D*` turns the game into a divergence with a unique minimizer, and I have no right to assume that survives the adaptation.

For fixed `G`, maximize `V` over `D`. The expectation, written out as integrals over the joint density of `(X̂, M)`, decomposes coordinatewise — coordinate `i` contributes `∫ [ log D(x)_i · p(x, m_i = 1) + log(1 − D(x)_i) · p(x, m_i = 0) ] dx`. Each integrand has the form `a log y + b log(1 − y)` in `y = D(x)_i`, with `a = p(x, m_i = 1)` and `b = p(x, m_i = 0)`. Differentiate: `a/y − b/(1 − y) = 0 ⟹ a(1 − y) = b y ⟹ y = a/(a + b)`, and the second derivative `−a/y² − b/(1 − y)²` is negative, so it's the max. Therefore

  `D*(x)_i = p(x, m_i = 1) / [ p(x, m_i = 1) + p(x, m_i = 0) ] = p_m(m_i = 1 | x)`.

Same shape as the GAN result — the optimal discriminator is the true posterior of the mask given the (completed) vector. That part transfers cleanly.

Now substitute `D*` back to see `G`'s effective criterion. The substituted objective is `C(G) = E[ Σ_{i: M_i=1} log p_m(m_i=1 | X̂) + Σ_{i: M_i=0} log p_m(m_i=0 | X̂) ]`. In the GAN case, plugging `D*` in gave a divergence whose unique minimizer is `p_g = p_data`. Does this `C(G)` have a unique minimizer that is the true data distribution? Minimizing it means `G` wants `D*` to fail — wants `p_m(m_i | X̂)` to be as uninformative as possible, i.e. wants the completed vector `X̂` to carry no information about which coordinates were holes. The condition for `D` to be helpless on coordinate `i` is that `X̂` is conditionally independent of `M_i`: `p̂(x | m_i = t)` doesn't depend on `t`. Suppose `G` achieves that for every `i`. Does that force the imputed distribution to equal the true data distribution? I genuinely don't know — and the GAN analogy makes me *want* to believe yes, so I should distrust the wish and check it.

The cleanest way to check is to make the space small enough to count and solve exactly. Take `X = (X_1, X_2, X_3)`, each Bernoulli, MCAR so `M ⟂ X`, and let the mask be missing-each-coordinate-independently with probability `1/2` (so `p(m) = 1/8` for all eight masks). Now the generator is a fully explicit finite object: for each mask `m`, on the observed coordinates `X̂` equals the true data, and on the hole coordinates `G` supplies some conditional distribution over the hole-atoms. Summing `2^(holes)` filler probabilities over the eight masks gives 27 raw filler variables, with the eight per-mask "sums to one" equations carried as separate normalization constraints. The "independence of each `M_i`" condition is `p̂(x | m_i = 0) = p̂(x | m_i = 1)` for every coordinate `i ∈ {1,2,3}` and every atom `x ∈ {0,1}^3` — that's `3 × 8 = 24` linear equalities. So it is a finite linear system in 27 unknowns and I can just solve it.

I assemble those 24 equality rows as linear functionals of the filler variables (each `p̂(x | M_i=t)` is the `p(m)`-weighted average of the per-mask conditionals over masks with `m_i=t`), add the 8 per-mask normalization rows, and compute the rank. The independence rows alone have rank 19, not 24 — several are dependent. Together with normalization the full constraint matrix has rank 24, against 27 variables, so the solution space has dimension `27 − 24 = 3`. It is **not** a point. To make sure that 3-dimensional slack is real and not an artifact of redundant equations, I take the truth (all fillers uniform, the genuine Bernoulli(½)³) and add a perturbation drawn from the null space of (independence ∧ per-mask-zero-sum), scaled to stay a valid distribution: e.g. on mask `(1,0,0)` the two-hole filler moves from uniform `0.25/0.25/0.25/0.25` to `0.187/0.203/0.297/0.313`. I then plug this alternative generator back into the 24 independence equations and the maximum residual is `~10⁻¹⁷`. So here is a concrete second generator, demonstrably different from the truth, that makes the mask-predicting `D` exactly as helpless on every single coordinate. Adversarial training *alone* — `G` fooling a mask-predicting `D` — does **not** pin `G` to the right distribution; the optimum is a 3-parameter family and only one point of it is correct. This is where the GAN analogy breaks: the imputation game as set up is underdetermined.

I need to *add constraints* to the game so the unique optimum becomes the true distribution. I can't change the data or the masking — those are given. What I *can* control is the information `D` gets. Right now `D` sees only `X̂` and has to guess the entire mask from scratch. What if I tell `D` something about `M` for free, and force it to focus its discrimination on the parts I *don't* tell it? Then the only way `G` can fool `D` is on those withheld parts — which tightens the game exactly where I need constraints.

So introduce a *hint*: a random variable `H`, depending on `M`, that I define and pass to `D` as an extra input, `D : X × H → [0,1]^d`, with `D(x̂, h)_i = P(m_i = 1 | x̂, h)`. By choosing how much `H` reveals about `M`, I control how underdetermined the game is. The optimal-`D` derivation is unchanged except for carrying `h` along: `D*(x, h)_i = p_m(m_i = 1 | x, h)`. And the question becomes: what does `H` have to reveal so that the unique solution is the true distribution?

I need the precise condition with `H` inside the game. Substituting `D*(x,h)_i = p_m(m_i=1 | x, h)` and writing the selected log term as `log p_m(m_i=t | x,h)`,

  `C(G) = E_{X̂,M,H}[ Σ_{i:M_i=1} log p_m(m_i=1 | X̂, H) + Σ_{i:M_i=0} log p_m(m_i=0 | X̂, H) ]`.

Write it as integrals and group by coordinate `i` and value `t ∈ {0,1}`:

  `C(G) = Σ_i Σ_t ∫∫ p(x, h, m_i = t) log p_m(m_i = t | x, h) dh dx`,

integrating over `h` in the region `H_t^i = { h : p_h(h | m_i = t) > 0 }`. Now expand the posterior `p_m(m_i = t | x, h) = p(x, m_i = t | h) / p̂(x | h)`, and factor the numerator the other way, `p(x, m_i = t | h) = p̂(x | h, m_i = t) · p_m(m_i = t | h)`. So the log splits, using `log(ab) = log a + log b`:

  `log p_m(m_i=t | x,h) = log[ p̂(x | h, m_i=t) / p̂(x | h) ] + log p_m(m_i = t | h)`.

Put that back. The second piece, `log p_m(m_i = t | h)`, has no `x` in it, so integrating `x` out of `p(x, h, m_i=t)` against it just leaves `∫ p_m(m_i=t, h) log p_m(m_i=t | h) dh` — a term that does **not** depend on `G` at all (it's about how the mask relates to the hint, which I fixed). The first piece is where `G` lives. Writing `p(x, h, m_i=t) = p_m(m_i=t, h) · p̂(x | h, m_i=t)`, that term is

  `Σ_i Σ_t ∫ p_m(m_i=t, h) [ ∫ p̂(x | h, m_i=t) log( p̂(x | h, m_i=t) / p̂(x | h) ) dx ] dh`,

and the inner `x`-integral is exactly a Kullback–Leibler divergence, `D_KL( p̂(· | h, m_i=t) ‖ p̂(· | h) )`. So the whole thing collapses to

  `C(G) = Σ_{i=1}^d Σ_{t∈{0,1}} ∫_{H_t^i} p_m(m_i=t, h) · D_KL( p̂(· | h, m_i=t) ‖ p̂(· | h) ) dh  +  (G-independent constant)`.

This is playing the same role as GAN's `C(G) = −log 4 + 2·JSD`: a nonnegative divergence term plus a constant. `G` minimizes `C(G)`, and since each KL is `≥ 0` with equality iff its two arguments coincide, the minimum is attained **iff** for every `i, t, h` (with `p_h(h | m_i=t) > 0`) and almost every `x`,

  `p̂(x | h, m_i = t) = p̂(x | h)`.  (*)

The minimum value is that leftover constant — which has a nice reading: the best a discriminator can ever do is predict the mask from the *hint alone*, using nothing from `x̂`, just exploiting whatever correlation the hint carries about `M`. That's the target state: `X̂` tells `D` nothing about the mask beyond what the hint already gave away.

Condition (*) says `X̂` is conditionally independent of each `M_i` *given the hint `H`*. I need `H` to make that condition have a **unique** solution, and I need that solution to be the true data distribution.

The no-information case has to be genuinely broken, otherwise the hint would just be decoration. If `H` is independent of `M` (which is the same as having no hint, since then `H` tells `D` nothing about the mask), then `H` drops out of (*) and it becomes `p̂(x | m_i = t) = p̂(x)` for all `i, t`, equivalently `p̂(x | m_i = 0) = p̂(x | m_i = 1)` for all `i`. That is exactly the underdetermined system I just solved on the Bernoulli example — the one whose solution space came out three-dimensional, with an explicit alternative generator sitting in it. So with no hint, or with a hint independent of `M`, the optimum is not unique and `G` is not forced to the true distribution. The hint has to actually carry information about `M`.

So how much information? If I reveal *all* of `M` to `D`, the game is trivial — `D` reads the answer off the hint and `G` gets no gradient about anything. If I reveal *nothing*, it's underdetermined. I want the minimal withholding that still pins the solution. The natural idea: reveal all of `M` *except one* coordinate, and force `D` to fight `G` only on that one. Let me build that. Sample an index `k` uniformly from `{1, ..., d}` and set a selector `B` with `B_j = 1` for `j ≠ k` and `B_k = 0`. Then define the hint

  `H = B ⊙ M + 0.5 (1 − B)`,  taking values in `{0, 0.5, 1}^d`.

Read it off: for `j ≠ k`, `B_j = 1` so `H_j = M_j` — the true mask value is handed to `D`. For `j = k`, `B_k = 0` so `H_k = 0.5` — a neutral value that, by itself, says nothing about whether `M_k` was 0 or 1. So `H` reveals `d − 1` components of the mask and hides exactly one. Note `H_i = t ∈ {0,1} ⟹ M_i = t` deterministically, while `H_i = 0.5` is genuinely ambiguous about `M_i`.

Let me check `D`'s behavior on the revealed coordinates, because I want to be sure they carry no gradient for `G`. On a revealed coordinate, `h_i ∈ {0,1}` and `h_i = t ⟹ m_i = t` with certainty, so `p_m(m_i = t | h_i = t) = 1`. By the optimal-`D` formula `D*(x, h)_i = p_m(m_i = 1 | x, h)`, this means `D*(x,h)_i = h_i` exactly: `D` should just echo the hint on the revealed coordinates, for every `x`. Those outputs are constant in `x`, so they tell `G` nothing — and if I make the clean update learn those coordinates too, I only teach `D` to copy the hint. The loss I derive from this should focus on the *hidden* coordinate(s), the ones with `b_i = 0`, where the only `G`-dependent signal is.

Take any two masks `m_0, m_1` that differ in exactly one coordinate `i` — say `m_0` has 0 there and `m_1` has 1, agreeing everywhere else. Build the hint that reveals all the agreed coordinates and sets the `i`-th to 0.5: `h_j = m_j` for `j ≠ i`, `h_i = 0.5`. This *same* `h` is reachable from *both* masks — `p_h(h | m_i = 0) > 0` and `p_h(h | m_i = 1) > 0` — because flipping only the hidden coordinate doesn't change any revealed value. So condition (*) applies at this `h` for both `t = 0` and `t = 1`, giving `p̂(x | h, m_i = 0) = p̂(x | h, m_i = 1)` for all `x`. Now unwind the conditioning on the hint. Conditioning on this `h` and on `m_i=t` pins down the full mask `m_t` and the selector event `B=b`, where `b_i=0` and `b_j=1` for `j≠i`. Since `B` is sampled independently of `(X,M)`, once `M=m_t` is fixed, conditioning further on `B=b` changes no density over `x`:

  `p̂(x | h, m_i = t) = p̂(x | m_t, B=b) = p̂(x | m_t)`.

If I write the same step with unnormalized joint densities, the common factor `P(B=b)` appears for both `t=0` and `t=1` and cancels. Either way, the equality `p̂(x | h, m_i=0) = p̂(x | h, m_i=1)` collapses to

  `p̂(x | m_0) = p̂(x | m_1)`.

So: the imputed distribution conditioned on any mask equals the imputed distribution conditioned on any mask differing in one coordinate. But any two masks `m, m'` in `{0,1}^d` are connected by a chain of single-coordinate flips, so chaining the equality along that path, `p̂(x | m) = p̂(x | m')` for **all** masks. In particular `p̂(x | m) = p̂(x | 1)` for every `m`, where `1` is the all-observed mask. And conditioned on `M = 1`, every coordinate is observed, so `X̂ = X` — meaning `p̂(x | 1)` is precisely the true data density of `X` (using MCAR, `M ⟂ X`, so observing doesn't bias the distribution). Therefore the only solution to (*) should be `p̂` equal to the true data distribution.

That argument has more moving parts than I'm comfortable asserting from, so I run it back through the same Bernoulli system as a check. The leave-one-out hint condition, on the `X = (X_1,X_2,X_3)` example, says exactly: for every pair of masks differing in one coordinate, `p̂(x | m_0) = p̂(x | m_1)` for all atoms `x`. I assemble all those single-flip equality rows (there are 12 neighboring mask-pairs, `12 × 8 = 96` rows, plus the 8 normalization rows) over the same 27 filler variables and recompute the rank: it is 27, full. So the solution space is `27 − 27 = 0`-dimensional — a single point — where the no-hint version left dimension 3. And solving that point out, every filler comes back uniform, i.e. exactly the true Bernoulli(½)³ generator. So on this example the hint genuinely converts the three-parameter family of fakes into the unique truth; the chaining argument isn't just plausible, it lands where I claimed. The hint must reveal exactly `d − 1` components: enough to glue all the mask-conditionals together (the rank jumps from 24 to 27 precisely because each retained single-flip equality removes a slack direction), but it must hide at least one so that `G` still faces a real adversary somewhere and the game retains a learning signal.

Without the hint, "`X̂` independent of `M_i`" leaves `G` free to make the conditional distributions `p̂(· | m)` differ across masks as long as no single `M_i` is individually predictable; the all-but-one hint conditions on everything else, so independence-given-the-rest forces those conditionals to coincide, which is far stronger and pins down the truth.

The game now has a unique, correct optimum, so I can turn it into an algorithm I can run. Like the GAN, I'll solve `min_G max_D` by alternating stochastic gradient steps: optimize `D` for a bit with `G` fixed, then optimize `G` with `D` fixed, on minibatches; both `G` and `D` are fully-connected nets.

The clean `D` step follows that revealed-coordinate argument directly. Draw a minibatch of `k_D` samples `(x̃(j), m(j))`; for each draw noise `z(j)` and a selector `b(j)`, form `x̄(j) = G(x̃(j), m(j), z(j))`, `x̂(j) = m(j) ⊙ x̃(j) + (1 − m(j)) ⊙ x̄(j)`, and `h(j) = b(j) ⊙ m(j) + 0.5(1 − b(j))`. Train the discriminator on the hidden coordinates `b_i = 0`, where the `G`-dependent signal is:

  `L_D(m, m̂, b) = Σ_{i : b_i = 0} [ m_i log m̂_i + (1 − m_i) log(1 − m̂_i) ]`,

with `m̂ = D(x̂, h)`, and update `D` by descending `−Σ_j L_D(m(j), m̂(j), b(j))` (maximize the log-likelihood of predicting the true mask on the hidden slots).

For `G`, the pressure should go the other way: make `D` mistake imputed values for observed ones. On the hidden, imputed coordinates (`b_i = 0` and `m_i = 0`), I want to push `m̂_i` toward 1 so `D` thinks "observed." The faithful adversarial term would be to minimize `Σ (1 − m_i) log(1 − m̂_i)` on those slots, but that's the saturating form: early on, when `G` is bad, `D` is confidently right (`m̂_i ≈ 0` on the fakes), `log(1 − m̂_i) ≈ 0`, and the gradient vanishes — `G` can't get going. This is the same saturation GANs hit, and the same fix applies: instead of minimizing `log(1 − m̂)`, *maximize* `log m̂` (equivalently minimize `−log m̂`). Same fixed point, far stronger gradient when `D` is winning. So

  `L_G(m, m̂, b) = − Σ_{i : b_i = 0} (1 − m_i) log m̂_i`.

The adversary constrains the *distribution* of the imputed coordinates, but the observed coordinates give me direct pointwise supervision. This is where I cash in the earlier decision to let `G` output a value for *every* coordinate, including observed ones. For observed coordinates I *know* the truth — it's `x̃` — so I can directly supervise the raw generator output `x̄` to reproduce it. That's an autoencoder-style reconstruction loss on the observed slots:

  `L_M(x, x') = Σ_i m_i · L_M(x_i, x_i')`,  with  `L_M(x_i, x_i') = (x_i' − x_i)²` if `x_i` is continuous, `−x_i log(x_i')` if `x_i` is binary,

applied to `(x̃, x̄)` on the `m_i = 1` slots. I must not compare against `x̂` after completing the vector, because `x̂_i = x̃_i` on observed slots by construction and that would make the reconstruction term trivial. Comparing `G`'s own output to the known observed values pins those outputs to their truth, so `G` can't waste capacity on them and the only freedom left is in the holes. It also forces `G`'s hidden layers to actually *encode* the information in `x̃` (as in an autoencoder), which is exactly the information needed to impute the holes well. The reconstruction term and the adversarial term are pulling in compatible directions: reconstruction makes the representation faithful, the adversary makes the imputed *distribution* right. So `G` minimizes the weighted sum

  `Σ_j L_G(m(j), m̂(j), b(j)) + α · L_M(x̃(j), x̄(j))`,

with `α` a hyperparameter trading off "match the observed values" against "fool the discriminator on the holes." Sweep `α` over something like `{0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 10}` and pick by cross-validation — small `α` and `G` is all adversary, large `α` and it's all reconstruction; there's a sweet spot.

Let me settle the architecture knobs by what the problem needs. The data is mixed continuous/binary; min-max normalize every column to `[0, 1]` up front so everything lives on a common bounded scale, which means the generator's output should be squashed to `[0,1]` — a sigmoid output layer. `D` takes the completed vector concatenated with the hint as input (both are `d`-dimensional, so its first layer sees `2d` inputs); `G` takes the noise-filled partial vector concatenated with the mask (again `2d` in). Three fully connected layers for each network are enough structure to capture nonlinear feature interactions while keeping the tabular model small; using hidden width `d` in the runnable version keeps capacity proportional to the number of features. ReLU hidden layers, Adam for both nets, and minibatches are the standard robust choices in the implementation. The noise `Z` for the holes can be tiny — sampling each missing slot's noise from a small uniform like `U(0, 0.01)` is plenty; it just needs to break symmetry and let `G` represent a distribution, not flood the input with variance.

One practical wrinkle on the hint matters when I turn this into code. The clean theory uses the "leave exactly one out" selector `B` (one `k` per sample, `H_k = 0.5`). For the actual training loop I can draw each `B_i` independently with probability `hint_rate`, then pass `H = M ⊙ B` to `D`. This drops the `0.5` sentinel and uses `0` for both hidden entries and revealed missing entries, but with `hint_rate` near 1 it keeps most mask information visible and spreads the uncertain-coordinate signal across outputs over training. I can also use the full componentwise mask-prediction cross-entropy for `D`; the generator's adversarial term still concentrates on imputed coordinates through the factor `(1 − M)`.

Let me also be careful about numerics in the losses: the cross-entropies have `log` of the discriminator outputs, which can be 0 or 1 at the edges, so I floor with a small `1e-8` inside every `log`. And for the reconstruction term, since I normalized to `[0,1]`, the squared-error form on the observed slots, averaged with a denominator counting the observed entries, keeps the scale sane.

Now let me write the whole thing as the imputer I'd actually run, filling the one empty slot in the fit/transform harness — the imputation model is the adversarial pair plus its training loop. I normalize and fill holes with small noise, build `G` (partial vector + mask to completion through ReLU layers and a sigmoid output) and `D` (completion + hint to per-coordinate observed-probabilities), wire up the mask-prediction discriminator loss, the non-saturating generator adversarial loss plus the `α`-weighted reconstruction loss, alternate Adam steps, then impute by running `G` on the full dataset, keep observed values, denormalize, and round the categorical columns.
