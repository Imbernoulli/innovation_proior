Let me start from what actually hurts. I have diffusion models that generate gorgeous images by reversing a process that turns data into Gaussian noise, and I have a pile of problems that look almost identical — sketch to photo, edges to handbags, day to night, deblurring, inpainting — where the thing I'm handed is *not* noise. It's a structured image from some source distribution, and I want the matching target image. Every time I try to bend a diffusion model to this I end up with a hack: condition the denoiser on the source and pray; or SDEdit, where I add some noise to the source and run an unconditional model, forever tuning how much structure to keep against how much to regenerate; or DDIB, two separate unconditional models with a shared latent. None of these is principled. They map in one direction only, they lose cycle consistency, and I genuinely cannot say what distribution they sample from. So the real task is cleaner than any of these patches: I have *paired* data `(x_0, x_T) ~ p_data(x, y)` — target and source together — and I want a generative process that transports from the source endpoint `x_T = y` back to a sample of `p(x_0 | x_T)`. Two arbitrary distributions, given as the two ends of a path, neither of them forced to be noise.

What do I have to build with? The score-based machinery is excellent and I do not want to throw it away. A forward SDE `dx_t = f(x_t,t) dt + g(t) dw_t` carries data to a prior; Anderson's theorem says its time reversal is again a diffusion, `dx_t = [f - g^2 ∇log p_t(x_t)] dt + g dw_bar`, and there's a deterministic probability-flow ODE `dx_t = [f - ½ g^2 ∇log p_t(x_t)] dt` with the *same* marginals. The only unknown is the score `∇log p_t`, and I get it for free from denoising score matching because the forward kernel is Gaussian, `x_t = α_t x_0 + σ_t ε`, so `∇log p(x_t|x_0)` is closed form and regressing onto it recovers the marginal score. The clock is the signal-to-noise ratio `SNR_t = α_t²/σ_t²`. This is all beautiful — and all of it assumes the prior is a *Gaussian*. The forward SDE has no idea how to drive itself to a *particular* point; it only knows how to forget. That's the wall: the entire formalism is welded to noise at one end.

Is there any way to force a diffusion to land on a specific point? There is, and it's old. Doob's h-transform: take the base diffusion and add a drift,
`dx_t = [f(x_t,t) + g²(t) h(x_t,t,y,T)] dt + g(t) dw_t`, with `h(x_t,t,y,T) = ∇_{x_t} log p(x_T = y | x_t)`, the gradient of the base diffusion's *backward* transition kernel. This process is guaranteed to arrive at `x_T = y` almost surely. And when the base kernel is Gaussian, `p(x_T|x_t)` is Gaussian, so `h` is closed form. Pin the other end too — fix `x_0` as well — and I have a *diffusion bridge*, a process tied down at both ends, studied for decades in probability. Stare at that extra drift `g²h` for a second: it's a gradient of a log-likelihood of hitting `y`, scaled by `g²`, added to the dynamics. That is *exactly* the shape of classifier guidance, where you add `∇log p(class|x_t)` to steer a diffusion. So `h` is a "guidance toward the endpoint." Good — that's an intuition I can lean on later.

But a bridge with both ends pinned isn't yet a generative model. I have a forward process that, for *fixed* `x_0` and `x_T`, wiggles between them. To *generate*, I need to start at the source `x_T` and walk back to a *sample* of the target, which means I need the reverse-time dynamics of the bridge when `x_0` is unknown and only `x_T` is given — and I need a *learnable* score for it, because the true score of that marginal isn't something I can write down. Let me set up the object precisely. I'll build a process `{x_t}` whose joint endpoints `q(x_0, x_T)` match `p_data(x, y)`, and generating means sampling `q(x_t | x_T)` backward. This `q` is not the diffusion's `p`: under a diffusion, `x_T` given `x_0` is Gaussian; here `x_T` is real data correlated with `x_0`.

First I need a tractable thing to train on. For diffusion the enabling object was a closed-form `p(x_t|x_0)`. The analogue here is the bridge marginal pinned at *both* endpoints, `q(x_t|x_0,x_T)`, and I can just *define* it to equal the diffusion pinned at both ends, which Bayes hands me:
`q(x_t|x_0,x_T) = p(x_T|x_t) p(x_t|x_0) / p(x_T|x_0)`.
Every factor on the right is Gaussian for a VE/VP base, so the product is Gaussian and I can read off its mean and variance by completing the square. Let me actually do it rather than wave at it. Write the three densities for scalar `x` (it's isotropic, so per-coordinate is enough):
`p(x_t|x_0) ∝ exp(-(x_t - α_t x_0)²/(2σ_t²))`,
`p(x_T|x_0) ∝ exp(-(x_T - α_T x_0)²/(2σ_T²))`,
and `p(x_T|x_t)`, the base-diffusion kernel from `t` to `T`, which for `s > t` is `N(α_{s|t} x_t, σ_{s|t}² )` with `α_{s|t} = α_s/α_t` and variance `σ_T² - (α_T²/α_t²)σ_t²`. Rewriting that last one in terms of `x_t` rather than `x_T`,
`p(x_T|x_t) ∝ exp( -((α_T/α_t) x_t - x_T)² / (2(σ_T² - (α_T²/α_t²)σ_t²)) ) = exp( -(x_t - (α_t/α_T) x_T)² / (2σ_t²(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1)) )`,
where I used `SNR_t = α_t²/σ_t²` to fold the algebra. Now collect the exponent of the product divided by `p(x_T|x_0)`:
`-(x_t - α_t x_0)²/(2σ_t²) - (x_t - (α_t/α_T)x_T)²/(2σ_t²(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1)) + (x_T - α_T x_0)²/(2σ_T²)`.
It's a quadratic in `x_t`; the last term has no `x_t`, so it only sets the normalization. The coefficient of `x_t²` is `(1/σ_t²)(1 + 1/(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1)) = (1/σ_t²)·(SNR_t/SNR_T)/(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1)`. Invert that and the variance falls out:
`σ_hat_t² = σ_t²·(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1)/(SNR_t/SNR_T) = σ_t²(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`.
The mean is `σ_hat_t²` times the linear coefficient. The linear-in-`x_t` part is `(α_t x_0)/σ_t² + ((α_t/α_T)x_T)/(σ_t²(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1))`, so
`μ_hat_t = σ_hat_t²·[ α_t x_0/σ_t² + (α_t/α_T)x_T/(σ_t²(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1)) ]`.
Multiply through using `σ_hat_t² = σ_t²(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`: the `x_0` term becomes `α_t x_0(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`, and the `x_T` term, after `(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)/(SNR_t/SNR_T - 1) = SNR_T/SNR_t` cleans up, becomes `(SNR_T/SNR_t)(α_t/α_T)x_T`. So
`μ_hat_t = (SNR_T/SNR_t)(α_t/α_T) x_T + α_t x_0 (1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`, `σ_hat_t² = σ_t²(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`.
Look at what this says. The mean is a *linear interpolation between the (scaled) endpoints*: weight `SNR_T/SNR_t` on `x_T` and `1 - SNR_T/SNR_t` on `x_0`. At `t = T`, `SNR_T/SNR_t = 1`, so the mean is `(α_T/α_T)x_T = x_T` and the variance is `0` — a Dirac at the source, exactly the pin I wanted. At `t → 0`, `SNR_T/SNR_t → 0` (the SNR explodes as noise vanishes), so the mean → `α_0 x_0` and variance → `0` — a Dirac at the target. So this Gaussian is genuinely a *bridge*: tight at both ends, fat in the middle, and tractable to sample from given the endpoints. That clears the training-tractability bar.

Now the generative side: I need the time-reversal of `q(x_t|x_T)`, where I've marginalized out the unknown `x_0`. I can't just quote Anderson's reverse-SDE formula because that's for an *unconditioned* diffusion; my process has the extra h-drift baked in, and I've pinned `x_T`. Let me derive the dynamics from the bottom by tracking how the density evolves. Fix both endpoints first and use `q(x_t|x_0,x_T) = p(x_T|x_t)p(x_t|x_0)/p(x_T|x_0)`. The denominator is constant in `t`, so
`∂_t q(x_t|x_0,x_T) = [p(x_t|x_0)/p(x_T|x_0)] ∂_t p(x_T|x_t) + [p(x_T|x_t)/p(x_T|x_0)] ∂_t p(x_t|x_0)`.
Two pieces. The second factor, `p(x_t|x_0)`, is a marginal of the *forward* diffusion, so it obeys the Kolmogorov forward (Fokker-Planck) equation
`∂_t p(x_t|x_0) = -∇·[f p(x_t|x_0)] + ½ g² ∇·∇ p(x_t|x_0)`.
The first factor, `p(x_T|x_t)` with `x_T` *fixed* and `x_t` the variable, is a transition probability read backward, so it obeys the Kolmogorov *backward* equation
`-∂_t p(x_T|x_t) = f·∇ p(x_T|x_t) + ½ g² ∇·∇ p(x_T|x_t)`.
Substitute both. Call the two assembled terms ① (from `∂_t p(x_T|x_t)`) and ② (from `∂_t p(x_t|x_0)`):
① `= -(p(x_t|x_0)/p(x_T|x_0))·[ f·∇ p(x_T|x_t) + ½ g² ∇·∇ p(x_T|x_t) ]`,
② `= (p(x_T|x_t)/p(x_T|x_0))·[ -∇·(f p(x_t|x_0)) + ½ g² ∇·∇ p(x_t|x_0) ]`.
The two `f` terms want to recombine. `-(p(x_t|x_0)/Z) f·∇ p(x_T|x_t) - (p(x_T|x_t)/Z) ∇·(f p(x_t|x_0))`, with `Z = p(x_T|x_0)` — that's the product rule for `-∇·[f · (p(x_T|x_t)p(x_t|x_0)/Z)] = -∇·[f q(x_t|x_0,x_T)]`. Good, the advection term assembles cleanly. What's left is
`½ g²(③ - ④)`, where
③ `= (p(x_T|x_t)/Z) ∇·∇ p(x_t|x_0)` and
④ `= (p(x_t|x_0)/Z) ∇·∇ p(x_T|x_t)`.
This is *not* yet a single Laplacian of `q`, because `q` is a product and the Laplacian of a product has a cross term. So add and subtract exactly that cross term. The cross term I need is `(1/Z) ∇p(x_T|x_t)·∇p(x_t|x_0)`, and I can write it two ways using `∇p = p ∇log p`:
⑤ `= (1/Z) ∇p(x_t|x_0)·[ p(x_T|x_t) ∇log p(x_T|x_t) ]`,
⑥ `= (1/Z) ∇p(x_T|x_t)·[ p(x_t|x_0) ∇log p(x_t|x_0) ]`,
and ⑤ = ⑥. Now ③ + ⑥ is a product rule going the other way: `∇·( q ∇log p(x_t|x_0) )`, and ④ + ⑤ is `∇·( q ∇log p(x_T|x_t) )`. And by Bayes, `∇log q(x_t|x_0,x_T) = ∇log p(x_T|x_t) + ∇log p(x_t|x_0)` (the `p(x_T|x_0)` term has no `x_t`), so
`③+④+⑤+⑥ = ∇·( q ∇log q(x_t|x_0,x_T) ) = ∇·∇ q`.
But I only have `½ g²(③ - ④)`. Since ⑤ = ⑥, I can write
`½(③ - ④) = ½(③ + ④ + ⑤ + ⑥) - (④ + ⑤)`.
The first term is `½∇·∇q`; the second is `∇·(q ∇log p(x_T|x_t))`. Plugging back, the whole thing collapses to
`∂_t q(x_t|x_0,x_T) = -∇·[ (f + g² ∇log p(x_T|x_t)) q ] + ½ g² ∇·∇ q`.
That's a *Fokker-Planck equation with modified drift* `f + g² ∇log p(x_T|x_t) = f + g² h` — the h-transform drift, exactly. Reassuring: the pinned bridge is itself a diffusion whose drift is the base drift plus Doob's `g²h`. Now marginalize out `x_0` against `p_data(x_0|x_T)`. The drift `f + g²h` doesn't depend on `x_0` and the equation is linear in the density, so the expectation passes through and `E_{x_0}[q(x_t|x_0,x_T)] = q(x_t|x_T)` obeys the *same* Fokker-Planck:
`∂_t q(x_t|x_T) = -∇·[ (f + g²h) q(x_t|x_T) ] + ½ g² ∇·∇ q(x_t|x_T)`.

This is a *forward*-time Fokker-Planck with drift `f + g²h`. To sample I want the *reverse*-time process that produces the same marginals, so I redo Anderson's conversion but for this drift. A forward SDE with drift `b` and diffusion `g` has reverse-time SDE with drift `b - g²∇log q` (and the same `g`). Here `b = f + g²h`, so the reverse-time SDE drift is
`(f + g²h) - g² ∇log q(x_t|x_T) = f - g²( ∇log q(x_t|x_T) - h )`.
Let me name the learned score `s(x_t,t,y,T) = ∇log q(x_t|x_T)` and keep `h = ∇log p(x_T|x_t)`. So
reverse SDE: `dx_t = [ f - g²( s - h ) ] dt + g dw_bar`.
For the deterministic version I use Song's continuity conversion: any Fokker-Planck `∂_t q = -∇·(b q) + ½g²∇·∇q` can be rewritten as a pure continuity equation `∂_t q = -∇·(b̃ q)` with `b̃ = b - ½ g² ∇log q`, which has no diffusion term and hence a deterministic ODE with the *same* marginals. With `b = f + g²h`,
`b̃ = f + g²h - ½ g² s = f - g²( ½ s - h )`,
PF-ODE: `dx_t = [ f - g²( ½ s - h ) ] dt`.
I want to be careful here, because it's the kind of place I'd misremember. Only the *score* `s` gets the ½. The h-transform drift `h` does *not* get halved — it is part of the bridge's defining forward drift, not the thing that the SDE→ODE conversion splits. The ½ comes entirely from the `½ g² ∇log q` I peeled off to kill the diffusion term, and that acts only on `q`'s score `s`. If I'd reflexively halved the whole `(s - h)` bracket I'd have changed the very drift that pins the endpoint, and the ODE would no longer be a valid bridge. So: SDE has `(s - h)`, ODE has `(½ s - h)`. Hold onto that, it's load-bearing for the sampler.

Now the score `s = ∇log q(x_t|x_T)` is unknown, so I have to learn it — and I want the same cheap denoising identity diffusion uses. The target I *can* compute is the conditional score `∇log q(x_t|x_0,x_T)` of the pinned bridge, which is just `-(x_t - μ_hat_t)/σ_hat_t²` from the Gaussian I derived. Claim: regressing a network `s_θ(x_t,x_T,t)` onto that conditional score recovers the marginal score `∇log q(x_t|x_T)`. Let me confirm it's the standard denoising-score-matching identity and not something that breaks under the extra `x_T` conditioning. The loss is `E[ w(t) ‖s_θ - ∇log q(x_t|x_0,x_T)‖² ]` with `(x_0,x_T)~p_data`, `x_t ~ q(x_t|x_0,x_T)`, `t` from any nonzero `p(t)`. Since it's a per-`(x_t,x_T,t)` weighted `L₂` and the weights are nonzero, the minimizer is the conditional expectation of the target given `(x_t,x_T,t)`:
`s* = ∫ [q(x_t|x_0,x_T) p_data(x_0,x_T) / q(x_t,x_T)] ∇log q(x_t|x_0,x_T) dx_0`.
Use `∇log q(x_t|x_0,x_T) = ∇q(x_t|x_0,x_T)/q(x_t|x_0,x_T)` so the `q(x_t|x_0,x_T)` cancels:
`s* = ∫ [p_data(x_0,x_T)/q(x_t,x_T)] ∇_{x_t} q(x_t|x_0,x_T) dx_0 = ∇_{x_t}[ ∫ p_data(x_0,x_T) q(x_t|x_0,x_T) dx_0 ] / q(x_t,x_T) = ∇_{x_t} q(x_t,x_T) / q(x_t,x_T) = ∇log q(x_t|x_T)`,
because the numerator integral is exactly `q(x_t,x_T)` and `∇log q(x_t,x_T) = ∇log q(x_t|x_T)` (the `x_T`-only factor has zero `x_t`-gradient). So the network does recover the marginal bridge score; the conditioning on `x_T` rides along harmlessly. Training is: sample a pair `(x_0,x_T)`, sample `x_t` from the closed-form Gaussian bridge, regress onto its closed-form conditional score. Cheap, one network call, no path simulation. That's both bars — tractable marginal, closed-form objective — cleared.

Before I parameterize, let me check this is the *right* generalization by seeing what it contains, because if it doesn't reduce to plain diffusion and to flow matching, I've built a competitor rather than a unification. Take the data joint to be `p_data(x_0,x_T) = p(x_T|x_0)p_data(x_0)` with `x_T|x_0 ~ N(α_T x_0, σ_T² I)` — i.e. force the "source" to be a noised version of the target, the diffusion setup. Then marginally `x_t` should be the ordinary diffusion `N(α_t x_0, σ_t² I)`. Check: write `r = SNR_T/SNR_t`. From the bridge sample `x_t = r(α_t/α_T)x_T + α_t x_0(1-r) + σ_t√(1-r) ε₁` and substitute `x_T = α_T x_0 + σ_T ε₂`. The `x_0` coefficient becomes `rα_t + α_t(1-r) = α_t`. The noise becomes `r(α_t/α_T)σ_T ε₂ + σ_t√(1-r) ε₁`, a sum of independent Gaussians. Its first variance is
`r²(α_t²/α_T²)σ_T² = r σ_t²`,
because `r = (α_T²/σ_T²)/(α_t²/σ_t²)`. The second variance is `σ_t²(1-r)`, so the total is `σ_t²`. Thus `x_t = α_t x_0 + σ_t ε`, exactly the diffusion marginal. And the FPE reduces too: marginalize the bridge FPE over `x_T ~ p(x_T)`. The drift's h-term is `g² E_{x_T}[ p(x_t|x_T) ∇log p(x_T|x_t) ]`, and writing the expectation as an integral, `∫ p(x_T) p(x_t|x_T) ∇log p(x_T|x_t) dx_T = p(x_t) ∫ p(x_T|x_t) ∇log p(x_T|x_t) dx_T = p(x_t) ∫ ∇p(x_T|x_t) dx_T = p(x_t) ∇∫ p(x_T|x_t) dx_T = p(x_t) ∇1 = 0`. The h-drift integrates to zero, and what's left is precisely the unconditional diffusion's Fokker-Planck. So plain diffusion is the special case where `x_T` is Gaussian — the h-guidance vanishes on average because there's no information in a noise endpoint to be pulled toward. That's a satisfying sanity check.

And flow matching? Take a VE base (`f = 0`, `σ_t² = c²t`), scale the bridge variance by `c`, and send `c → 0`. The interpolation mean is `m_t = (t/T)x_T + (1 - t/T)x_0`, so `x_t = m_t + c√(t(1-t/T))ε`. The conditional bridge score is `-(x_t-m_t)/(c²t(1-t/T)) = O(1/c)`, so the `-c²·½s` part of the PF-ODE vanishes as `O(c)`. The h-term is
`c² h = c²(x_T-x_t)/(c²(T-t)) = (x_T - m_t)/(T-t) + O(c)`.
But `x_T - m_t = (1-t/T)(x_T-x_0)`, so `c²h = (x_T-x_0)/T + O(c)`. At `T=1`, the limiting drift is `x_T - x_0`. That's the rectified-flow / OT velocity field exactly. The catch: at `c → 0` the bridge score blows up, so I can't keep matching the score — I'd match the *drift* `x_T - x_0` directly, which is precisely what flow matching does by regressing velocity onto the straight-line direction. So flow matching is the noiseless limit of the VE bridge, and my framework strictly contains it. Two reductions, two clean recoveries: I'm generalizing, not competing.

Now I need to *parameterize* `s_θ`, and the diffusion world has a hard-won lesson here I should reuse: don't predict the score or the noise directly. EDM's argument is that if I predict noise and reconstruct `x_0 = x_t - σ F`, the network's errors get amplified by `σ` at high noise; predicting the clean signal with a `σ`-dependent skip is far more stable, and the variance of the `x_0` target does not drift with `t`. So I use a pred-`x_0` form `D_θ(x_t,t) = c_skip x_t + c_out F_θ(c_in x_t; c_noise)` and convert it back to a score. Let
`a_t = (α_t/α_T)(SNR_T/SNR_t)`, `b_t = α_t(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`, and `v_t = σ_t²(1 - SNR_T/SNR_t)`, so the bridge sample is `x_t = a_t x_T + b_t x_0 + √v_t ε`. Then replacing `x_0` by `D_θ` in the conditional score gives
`s ≈ -(x_t - (a_t x_T + b_t D_θ))/v_t`.
The canonical schedule code stores the standard-deviation coefficient `c_t = √v_t` — in its `(α,ρ)` parameterization, `c_t = α_t ρ_bar_t ρ_t / ρ_T` — so the implementation divides by `c_t²`. That square matters.

Now I have to *choose* the four scalings, and I want them forced by principle, not taste. The pred-`x_0` loss is `E[ w̃(t) ‖ c_skip x_t + c_out F_θ - x_0 ‖² ]` with `x_t = a_t x_T + b_t x_0 + √v_t ε`. The network input `c_in x_t` should have unit variance. Because the endpoints are correlated data, not data plus independent noise, I have to track `σ_0²`, `σ_T²`, and `σ_{0T}`:
`Var[x_t] = a_t²σ_T² + b_t²σ_0² + 2 a_t b_t σ_{0T} + v_t`.
So
`c_in(t) = 1/√(a_t²σ_T² + b_t²σ_0² + 2 a_t b_t σ_{0T} + v_t)`.
These two endpoint statistics `σ_T, σ_{0T}` are the only new ones versus EDM; they are what make this a paired-data problem rather than noise-to-data.

Now `c_out` and `c_skip`. Pull `c_out` out of the loss after substituting `x_t`:
`‖c_skip x_t + c_out F_θ - x_0‖² = c_out² ‖F_θ - (1/c_out)( (1 - c_skip b_t) x_0 - c_skip(a_t x_T + √v_t ε) )‖²`.
The effective target of `F_θ` should also have unit variance, so
`c_out² = (1 - c_skip b_t)²σ_0² + c_skip²(a_t²σ_T² + v_t) - 2(1 - c_skip b_t)c_skip a_t σ_{0T}`.
Two unknowns, one equation — EDM's tiebreaker is to *minimize* `c_out` over `c_skip`, because `c_out` multiplies the network's output and hence amplifies its error. Differentiate `c_out²` w.r.t. `c_skip` and set to zero:
`-2(1 - c_skip b_t)b_t σ_0² + 2 c_skip(a_t²σ_T² + v_t) - 2(1 - 2 c_skip b_t)a_t σ_{0T} = 0`.
Solving gives
`c_skip = (b_t σ_0² + a_t σ_{0T}) / (a_t²σ_T² + b_t²σ_0² + 2 a_t b_t σ_{0T} + v_t) = (b_t σ_0² + a_t σ_{0T})·c_in²`.
Back-substitute to simplify `c_out²`. Expanding and using the `c_skip` relation,
`c_out² = σ_0² - (b_t σ_0² + a_t σ_{0T})c_skip = σ_0² - (b_t σ_0² + a_t σ_{0T})²·c_in²`.
Put over `1/c_in²`: the numerator is `σ_0²(a_t²σ_T² + b_t²σ_0² + 2 a_t b_t σ_{0T} + v_t) - (b_t σ_0² + a_t σ_{0T})²`. The `b_t²σ_0⁴` cancels, the `2 a_t b_t σ_{0T}σ_0²` cancels, and I get `a_t²(σ_0²σ_T² - σ_{0T}²) + σ_0²v_t`. So
`c_out(t) = √(a_t²(σ_0²σ_T² - σ_{0T}²) + σ_0²v_t)·c_in(t)`,
and the loss weight to make the effective per-sample weight approximately one is `w̃(t) = 1/c_out(t)²`. For `c_noise` I reuse EDM's log-noise conditioning, `c_noise = ¼ log t`, since the time distribution is not materially different. Let me verify this collapses to EDM when the bridge is the diffusion special case: there `x_T = x_0 + Tε`, so `σ_T² = σ_0² + T²`, `σ_{0T} = σ_0²`, and in the VE corner `a_t = t²/T²`, `b_t = 1 - t²/T²`, `v_t = t²(1 - t²/T²)`. Substituting into `c_in`, the cross terms cancel and the radicand reduces to `σ_0² + t²`, so `c_in = 1/√(σ_0² + t²)`. `c_skip = ((1 - t²/T²)σ_0² + (t²/T²)σ_0²)/(σ_0²+t²) = σ_0²/(σ_0²+t²)`. And `c_out`: the radicand `(t⁴/T⁴)(σ_0²(σ_0²+T²) - σ_0⁴) + σ_0²t²(1-t²/T²) = (t⁴/T²)σ_0² + σ_0²t² - σ_0²t⁴/T² = σ_0²t²`, so `c_out = σ_0 t/√(σ_0²+t²)`. The diffusion preconditioning drops out exactly.

One more knob falls out of the h-as-guidance observation: since the ODE drift can be widened to `f - g²(½s - ωh)`, the endpoint pull can be scaled like classifier guidance. That is a useful sampler knob when I want to dial how hard the path is pulled toward the endpoint. For the concrete implementation I am grounding here, I keep the h-term unscaled, `ω=1`, so the code remains the direct SDE/ODE drift I derived.

Now sampling is where the obvious thing is wrong. I have a PF-ODE that I can integrate fast with high-order solvers, the way EDM does for generation. So why not just integrate the ODE backward from `x_T`? Because the bridge has a *fixed, given* starting point `x_T = y`, which is real data, not a fresh noise draw. Integrating a deterministic ODE backward from one fixed point produces *one* deterministic "expected" trajectory — the conditional mean path. For a genuinely one-to-many conditional mapping, many plausible targets can share one source, so the conditional mean is a blurry average and a pure ODE will hand me exactly that average. That's the wall: determinism plus a pinned start equals blur. I *need* stochasticity to recover diversity and sharpness.

So I should put noise back. But pure Euler-Maruyama on the reverse SDE is slow and inaccurate per step, and I'm under a tight budget on denoiser calls. I want the SDE's diversity *and* the ODE's per-step accuracy. The predictor-corrector idea from Song fits perfectly: alternate a numerical step that moves through time with a noise-injecting step that re-randomizes without advancing the marginal much. And EDM already showed the clean engineering of this for generation: each step, briefly *churn* — add a controlled bit of noise to bump up the noise level — then take an accurate deterministic step back down. The churn corrects accumulated error and, here, supplies the stochasticity the bridge needs; the deterministic step does the heavy lifting cheaply with a high-order integrator.

Concretely, discretize time with EDM's power-law schedule `t_i = (t_max^{1/ρ} + i/(N-1)(t_min^{1/ρ} - t_max^{1/ρ}))^ρ`, `ρ = 7` — that spacing equalizes truncation error well and is image-friendly (small `ρ` like 3 equalizes truncation error in theory but 5-10 sample better; 7 is the sweet spot). The actual array is decreasing and ends with a trailing zero. At a current time `t_cur = ts[i]`, choose `t_hat = t_cur + r(ts[i+1] - t_cur)` with step ratio `r`. I spend `[t_cur, t_hat]` on a stochastic Euler-Maruyama move, following the reverse SDE with drift factor `(s - h)` and injected `g·√|Δt|·noise`, then spend `[t_hat, ts[i+1]]` on a deterministic Heun move, following the ODE with factor `(½s - h)`. The churn keeps the per-step marginal close to the training marginal while restoring diversity; the Heun step integrates the deterministic part accurately. When `r = 0` I do no churn; for translation I want `r ≈ 1/3` so each step gets a real stochastic kick.

Let me write the per-step drift once, because both the SDE and ODE steps are the same object with one switch. Define, at time `t`, the denoiser output `D = D_θ(x_t,t)` (one network call), the bridge score from pred-`x_0` `s = -(x_t - (a_t x_T + b_t D))/c_t²` in the code's standard-deviation notation, the h-transform `h = -(x_t - (α_t/α_T)x_T)/(α_t² ρ_bar_t²)` with `ρ_bar_t² = ρ_T² - ρ_t²`, and the base drift/diffusion `f, g²`. Then the reverse drift is
`d = f x_t - g²·(κ·s - h)`, with `κ = 1` for the stochastic (SDE) step and `κ = ½` for the deterministic (ODE) step.
That single sign convention — the score `s` carrying the `κ` switch while `h` stays at full strength — is the SDE/ODE distinction I was careful about earlier, now living in one line of code. The Euler update is `x ← x + d·Δt + [stochastic] noise·√|Δt|·√(g²)`; the Heun (2nd-order) update recomputes `d₂` at the predicted endpoint, averages `d' = (d + d₂)/2`, and re-steps. On the *last* interval, where `t_{i+1} = 0`, I take a single Euler step rather than Heun (no valid second evaluation at `t=0`), which also saves a call. Counting calls: each Heun iteration costs the churn-Euler (1 call) plus the Heun predictor+corrector (2 calls) = 3, except the terminal Euler-only iteration. That's how I'd spend a fixed NFE budget — at a high-NFE reference setting, e.g. `ρ=7`, 17 iterations of which 16 are Heun (3 calls) and the last is churn+Euler (2 calls), totals 50 calls — and at a tight budget I'd shrink `N` and the churn accordingly.

Let me write it as code, filling the intermediate coefficients, the preconditioned `x_0` prediction, the per-step reverse update, and the call-scheduling loop:

```python

    ones = x.new_ones([x.shape[0]])

    alpha_t, alpha_bar_t, _, rho_bar_t = [

    grad_logpxTlxt = -(x - alpha_bar_t * x_T) / (alpha_t**2 * rho_bar_t**2)
    d = f_t * x - g2_t * ((0.5 if not stochastic else 1) * grad_logq - grad_logpxTlxt)
    return d, g2_t, denoised


def ddbm_simulate(denoiser, noise_schedule, x, x_T, t_cur, t_next, stochastic, second_order=False):
    dt = t_next - t_cur
    if isinstance(noise_schedule, I2SBNoiseSchedule):
        dt = dt * (noise_schedule.n_timestep - 1)
    d, g2_t, pred_x0 = get_d(denoiser, noise_schedule, x, x_T, t_cur, stochastic)

    return x_new, pred_x0


@torch.no_grad()
def sample_heun(denoiser, diffusion, x, ts, churn_step_ratio=0.0, **kwargs):
    x_T = x
    path, pred_x0, nfe = [], [], 0
    indices = tqdm(range(len(ts) - 1), disable=(dist.get_rank() != 0))
    assert churn_step_ratio < 1

    for _, i in enumerate(indices):
        if churn_step_ratio > 0:
            t_hat = (ts[i + 1] - ts[i]) * churn_step_ratio + ts[i]
            x, _p = ddbm_simulate(denoiser, diffusion.noise_schedule, x, x_T, ts[i], t_hat, stochastic=True)
            nfe += 1
            path.append(x.detach().cpu()); pred_x0.append(_p.detach().cpu())
        else:
            t_hat = ts[i]

        if ts[i + 1] == 0:
            x, _p = ddbm_simulate(denoiser, diffusion.noise_schedule, x, x_T, t_hat, ts[i + 1], stochastic=False)
            nfe += 1
        else:
            x, _p = ddbm_simulate(denoiser, diffusion.noise_schedule, x, x_T, t_hat, ts[i + 1],
                                  stochastic=False, second_order=True)
            nfe += 2
        path.append(x.detach().cpu()); pred_x0.append(_p.detach().cpu())
    return x, path, nfe, pred_x0, ts, None
```

So the chain closes. I started stuck because diffusion's whole formalism is welded to a Gaussian prior and can't natively start from a structured source image, leaving only unprincipled patches for translation. Doob's h-transform can pin a diffusion to a fixed endpoint, and pinning both ends gives a bridge — but a bridge alone isn't generative. I defined the training marginal as the doubly-pinned Gaussian via Bayes, completed the square to get a closed-form bridge whose mean linearly interpolates the endpoints and is Dirac at both ends, then derived the bridge's own Fokker-Planck by feeding the Kolmogorov forward and backward equations through the product rule, finding the drift is the base drift plus `g²h`; reversing it gave the reverse SDE `f - g²(s - h)` and, via the continuity identity that halves only the `q`-score, the PF-ODE `f - g²(½ s - h)`. I learn `s` by denoising bridge score matching against the closed-form conditional score, which the `L₂` minimizer proves recovers the true marginal score. Plain diffusion falls out when the source is a noised target (the h-drift integrates to zero), and rectified flow / OT falls out in the noiseless VE limit (match the straight-line drift), so the framework genuinely contains both. The pred-`x_0` EDM parameterization, with scalings forced by unit-variance of input and target and `c_skip` minimizing `c_out`, generalizes EDM's preconditioning by exactly the two endpoint statistics `σ_T, σ_{0T}` and reduces to it on the diffusion corner. Finally the sampler: a pure ODE from a pinned data start gives blurry conditional means, so I inject noise predictor-corrector style — a scheduled stochastic Euler "churn" step (SDE, `κ=1`) followed by an accurate deterministic Heun step (ODE, `κ=½`), on the EDM `ρ=7` schedule, with a step ratio `r` trading exploration against endpoint sharpness — which restores diversity while keeping the per-step marginal on the bridge, and the whole update is one drift line with `κ` switching the score's coefficient and `h` always at full strength.
