The thing that is killing me is the wall clock. I have a denoising model that draws images as good as a GAN, trained by a clean variational objective with none of the adversarial instability, and it is essentially unusable because pulling one image out of it means running a thousand sequential network passes. Twenty hours for fifty thousand small images; a GAN does the same in under a minute with a single pass. At 256×256 it is hundreds of hours. So the question I actually care about is narrow and concrete: can I get a sample out of this exact trained model in twenty or fifty steps instead of a thousand, ideally without retraining anything, because retraining a 256×256 model is itself days of compute.

Let me first be honest about *why* it is a thousand steps, because if the slowness is load-bearing I am wasting my time. The forward process slowly turns an image into Gaussian noise over T steps; the generative process is trained to invert it step by step. The reason T has to be large is that each true reverse conditional q(x_{t-1}|x_t) is only close to Gaussian when the step is small — when very little noise was added between x_{t-1} and x_t. If I take big steps, the reverse conditional is some complicated multimodal thing and a Gaussian model of it is wrong. So large T is not laziness, it is what makes the Gaussian generative model valid. That seems to nail the door shut: the generative chain approximates the reverse of the forward chain, the forward chain needs many steps to stay Gaussian-reversible, therefore the generative chain needs many steps. Slow by construction.

But wait. Let me look at what training actually pinned down, because the chain of "approximates the reverse of" is doing a lot of unexamined work. The objective, after all the variance-reduction algebra, is

  L_γ(ε_θ) = Σ_{t=1}^T γ_t · E_{x_0, ε} [ ‖ ε_θ^{(t)}(√α_t x_0 + √(1−α_t) ε) − ε ‖² ].

Stare at this. Two features of it matter, and I want to be precise about each before I lean on them. First, it is a sum of independent per-t terms. If the network does not share weights across t — if ε_θ^{(t)} is its own little function for each t — then minimizing the sum is just minimizing each term separately, and the minimizer of each term does not care what positive γ_t multiplies it. So the optimal ε_θ would be *the same function* no matter how I reweight the terms. Second, each term feeds the network √α_t x_0 + √(1−α_t) ε. That is a draw from the *marginal* q(x_t|x_0) = N(√α_t x_0, (1−α_t)I). The loss never once references the *joint* q(x_{1:T}|x_0). It never asks how x_t and x_{t-1} are correlated. It only ever asks the network to denoise a single marginal draw.

So what has the trained network actually committed to? On the evidence of the loss, only the marginals. It is a noise predictor for q(x_t|x_0), for each t, and nothing else. The Markov forward chain — the specific story about x_t depending only on x_{t-1} — was one particular joint that happens to have these marginals. It is one choice of how to thread the latents together. The training did not see it. So I should ask whether *any other* joint with the same marginals q(x_t|x_0) = N(√α_t x_0, (1−α_t)I) is, as far as the loss is concerned, served by the same trained network.

That reframes the speed problem, *if* the reframing survives contact with the algebra. The slowness came from "the generative process approximates the reverse of *the Markov chain*." If the network is wedded only to the marginals, then a *different* inference process — same marginals, different joint — whose corresponding reverse/generative process happens to be short, or deterministic, or both, would already be optimized by the same trained network. No retraining. The constraint I would have to respect is exactly one: preserve q(x_t|x_0) = N(√α_t x_0, (1−α_t)I) for every t. Two things have to actually check out before this is more than a hope: (a) that such a non-Markovian family genuinely exists and keeps the marginals, and (b) that its variational objective really reduces to the same ε-MSE I already minimized. Let me build the family and then test both.

OK so let me try to build such a joint q(x_{1:T}|x_0) whose every marginal is the fixed Gaussian. The cleanest way to control marginals is to specify the process *backwards*, conditioned on x_0, because then I can write down the reverse conditional q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) directly — which is also exactly the object the generative process will mimic. So factor

  q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = q(x_T|x_0) · ∏_{t=2}^T q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0),

set q(x_T|x_0) = N(√α_T x_0, (1−α_T)I) to nail the last marginal, and now I need to choose the reverse conditionals q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) so that the *other* marginals come out right too. Make them Gaussian — I want closed forms and I want the eventual KL terms to be tractable. The natural ansatz: the mean is affine in x_0 and x_t, the covariance is some σ_t² I. Write a free coefficient and pin it down by the marginal constraint. Let

  q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = N( √α_{t-1} x_0 + k_t·(x_t − √α_t x_0)/√(1−α_t) , σ_t² I ),

where I have already guessed the shape: a √α_{t-1} x_0 "signal" piece plus something proportional to the *residual* (x_t − √α_t x_0), which in distribution is √(1−α_t) ε, the noise that took x_0 to x_t. Dividing that residual by √(1−α_t) normalizes it to a unit-ish direction; k_t is the unknown scale I will solve for, and σ_t² is whatever variance I want to leave free.

Now impose the constraint by induction downward from t=T, where the marginal already holds. Suppose q(x_t|x_0) = N(√α_t x_0, (1−α_t)I). Marginalize x_t out of the product:

  q(x_{t-1}|x_0) = ∫ q(x_t|x_0) q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) dx_t.

This is a linear-Gaussian marginalization: x_t is Gaussian, x_{t-1} is Gaussian-given-x_t with a mean affine in x_t, so x_{t-1} is Gaussian and I just propagate. For the mean, substitute E[x_t] = √α_t x_0 into the mean of the conditional:

  mean = √α_{t-1} x_0 + k_t·(√α_t x_0 − √α_t x_0)/√(1−α_t) = √α_{t-1} x_0.

The residual term vanishes outright — because at the mean of x_t the residual is zero — so the mean is √α_{t-1} x_0 regardless of k_t. So the mean constraint is automatically satisfied by writing the conditional mean around (x_t − √α_t x_0). The variance is where k_t earns its keep. Var of x_{t-1} = (conditional variance) + (squared map coefficient)·(variance of x_t):

  Var = σ_t² + (k_t/√(1−α_t))²·(1−α_t) = σ_t² + k_t².

I need this to equal 1−α_{t-1}. So k_t² = 1 − α_{t-1} − σ_t², i.e.

  k_t = √(1 − α_{t-1} − σ_t²).

That is forced. The reverse conditional that preserves the marginals would then be

  q_σ(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = N( √α_{t-1} x_0 + √(1 − α_{t-1} − σ_t²)·(x_t − √α_t x_0)/√(1−α_t) , σ_t² I ),   (★)

with each σ_t free subject to 0 ≤ σ_t² ≤ 1−α_{t-1} so the square root is real.

I do not want to trust a hand-rolled marginalization that I am going to hang the whole method on, so let me actually run it on numbers. Take a tiny schedule of cumulative coefficients — α_0=1, α_1=0.8, α_2=0.5, α_3=0.2 — fix a data point x_0 = 1.7, pick an interior σ_t² at, say, 30% of its allowed range (1−α_{t-1}), compute k_t and the affine map's slope b = k_t/√(1−α_t), and propagate mean and variance through one step:

  t=3: σ²=0.150, k=0.592, b=0.661 → out-mean 1.202082, target √α_2·x_0 = 1.202082; out-var 0.500000, target 1−α_2 = 0.500000.
  t=2: σ²=0.060, k=0.374, b=0.529 → out-mean 1.520526, target √α_1·x_0 = 1.520526; out-var 0.200000, target 1−α_1 = 0.200000.
  t=1: σ²=0,     k=0,     b=0     → out-mean 1.700000, target √α_0·x_0 = 1.700000; out-var 0.000000, target 1−α_0 = 0.

Mean and variance land on the target marginal at every step, to all the digits I printed, for an interior σ I chose arbitrarily. To be sure the *whole* chain composes and I am not just checking one link at a time, I also sampled the backward process directly — draw x_3 from its marginal, then x_2 from q_σ(·|x_3,x_0), then x_1 — two million samples, interior σ at each step. Empirically x_3 has mean 0.761 / var 0.800 (targets 0.760 / 0.800), x_2 has mean 1.202 / var 0.500 (targets 1.202 / 0.500), x_1 has mean 1.521 / var 0.200 (targets 1.520 / 0.200). So the induction is not just formally closed, the simulated marginals match. One whole degree of freedom per step survives the marginal-matching — σ_t — and it is precisely the stochasticity of the reverse conditional. This is a *family* of inference processes, indexed by σ, all sharing the marginals my network was trained on. (And note what σ_t does to the *forward* direction: by Bayes, q_σ(x_t|x_{t-1},x_0) ∝ q_σ(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)q_σ(x_t|x_0)/q_σ(x_{t-1}|x_0), which is Gaussian but in general depends on x_0 as well as x_{t-1} — so for σ below the special value the forward process is no longer Markovian. x_t depends on both x_{t-1} and x_0. That is fine; I never needed it to be Markovian, I only needed the marginals, and those just checked out.)

Now turn the family into a *generative* process. At sample time I have x_t but not x_0, and (★) needs x_0. But that is exactly what the network gives me. The network predicts the noise ε in x_t = √α_t x_0 + √(1−α_t) ε, and inverting,

  f_θ(x_t) := (x_t − √(1−α_t)·ε_θ(x_t)) / √α_t

is a prediction of x_0 from x_t. So define the generative reverse step by plugging this predicted x_0 into (★): p_θ(x_{t-1}|x_t) = q_σ(x_{t-1}|x_t, f_θ(x_t)). Sampling from that Gaussian, and noticing that (x_t − √α_t f_θ)/√(1−α_t) = ε_θ(x_t) by the very definition of f_θ, the update is

  x_{t-1} = √α_{t-1}·f_θ(x_t)  +  √(1 − α_{t-1} − σ_t²)·ε_θ(x_t)  +  σ_t ε.   (◇)

Three pieces, and each has a reading. √α_{t-1}·f_θ is "jump to where the predicted clean image would sit at level t−1." √(1 − α_{t-1} − σ_t²)·ε_θ is a "direction pointing back toward x_t" — it re-injects, deterministically, exactly the amount of the predicted noise that the marginal at t−1 still wants to carry. And σ_t ε is fresh randomness. The density model can give the t=1 decoder a tiny Gaussian support term N(f_θ(x_1), σ_1² I); the sampler itself takes α_0 = 1, so the final implemented step returns the predicted clean image as σ_1 goes to zero.

That is constraint (a) discharged. Now constraint (b), which is the one that actually decides whether this is free: does the network trained by the unweighted ε-MSE optimize *this* generative process, for any σ I pick? If a different σ needed a different network, the whole no-retraining premise collapses, and I have built an elegant family I cannot use. So write down the variational objective for this generative process and see what it reduces to:

  J_σ(ε_θ) = E_{q_σ}[ log q_σ(x_{1:T}|x_0) − log p_θ(x_{0:T}) ].

Expand using the backward factorization of q_σ and the chain factorization of p_θ. The log q_σ(x_T|x_0) and the prior log p_θ(x_T) terms do not depend on θ, drop them. What is left, grouping the per-step pieces, is — up to θ-independent constants — a sum of KL divergences between the inference reverse conditional and the generative reverse conditional:

  J_σ ≡ Σ_{t=2}^T E_{x_0,x_t}[ KL( q_σ(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) ‖ p_θ(x_{t-1}|x_t) ) ] − E[ log p_θ(x_0|x_1) ].

Here is the payoff of building p_θ out of the *same* family (★): both arguments of each KL are Gaussians with the *same* covariance σ_t² I. They differ only in their means, and the means differ only in their x_0-slot — q_σ uses the true x_0, p_θ uses f_θ(x_t). A KL between two Gaussians with equal covariance σ²I is just ‖mean difference‖²/(2σ²), so I need the mean difference exactly, not just its direction. The x_t part cancels, but x_0 appears twice in the mean, once in the clean term and once inside the residual. For t>1 the difference is

  μ_q − μ_p = ( √α_{t-1} − √α_t·√(1−α_{t-1}−σ_t²)/√(1−α_t) ) · (x_0 − f_θ(x_t)).

Call that scalar λ_t. The whole reweighting argument is going to lean on λ_t being nonzero (so the term does not collapse) and on the resulting weight being positive (so "minimize the term" still means "match f_θ to x_0"). Let me actually check the sign over the admissible σ-range rather than wave at it. On the α_1=0.8, α_2=0.5, α_3=0.2 schedule, sweeping σ_t² from 0 up to its ceiling 1−α_{t-1}:

  t=3: λ = +0.354 (σ²=0), +0.411 (30%), +0.513 (70%), +0.696 (→ceiling).
  t=2: λ = +0.447 (σ²=0), +0.520 (30%), +0.649 (70%), +0.880 (→ceiling).

Strictly positive everywhere, and bounded away from zero, across the full range of σ for both steps. So λ_t² > 0 and the KL term is a genuine (non-degenerate) squared error in x_0:

  E[ λ_t² · ‖ x_0 − f_θ(x_t) ‖² / (2 σ_t²) ].

For t=1, where the decoder is N(f_θ(x_1), σ_1²I), the same form holds with λ_1 = 1. Now convert x_0 − f_θ to noise space. Both x_0 and f_θ are (x_t − √(1−α_t)·{ε or ε_θ})/√α_t, so

  x_0 − f_θ(x_t) = ( √(1−α_t)·ε_θ(x_t) − √(1−α_t)·ε ) / √α_t = (√(1−α_t)/√α_t)·(ε_θ − ε),

and therefore ‖x_0 − f_θ‖² = ((1−α_t)/α_t)·‖ε − ε_θ‖². Each term of J_σ becomes

  γ_t · E[ ‖ ε − ε_θ^{(t)}(√α_t x_0 + √(1−α_t) ε) ‖² ],

with

  γ_t = λ_t²(1−α_t)/(2 α_t σ_t²),     λ_t = √α_{t-1} − √α_t·√(1−α_{t-1}−σ_t²)/√(1−α_t)   for t>1,

and γ_1 = (1−α_1)/(2α_1σ_1²). Since λ_t² > 0 (just checked) and (1−α_t), α_t, σ_t² are all positive, every γ_t is positive. If the implementation writes the loss as an average per dimension instead of a summed norm, every γ_t is divided by that dimension; nothing else changes.

That is a per-t noise-prediction MSE. Summing over t,

  J_σ(ε_θ) = L_γ(ε_θ) + C,

with C collecting the θ-independent constants. So J_σ is L_γ for *some positive* γ — and the exact value of γ does not need to match the old Markov-chain variational weights, because of the first structural feature I noticed at the very start: when the per-t parameters are not shared, the minimizer of each term is independent of its positive weight, so the minimizer of L_γ is the same for every positive weighting. Therefore, for every strictly positive σ, the minimizer of J_σ is the minimizer of the unweighted ε-MSE; the deterministic σ=0 endpoint is reached as a limit. The plain unweighted noise-prediction loss that I already trained is a valid surrogate for every member of the family I can sample from. Both constraints, (a) and (b), held. One trained network; a whole continuum of generative processes.

Now spend the free knob σ. Two endpoints look interesting, and I want to know what each gives. The first claim I'd make is that one particular σ-value reproduces the original ancestral sampler — that the old DDPM is just a member of this family and "nothing special." That is the kind of statement I have caught myself asserting before, so let me actually compute the original DDPM reverse posterior and the q_σ conditional at the candidate σ and see whether they coincide. The candidate is σ_t = √((1−α_{t-1})/(1−α_t))·√(1 − α_t/α_{t-1}). The standard DDPM posterior q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0), with per-step coefficient α'_t = α_t/α_{t-1}, has variance (1−α_{t-1})/(1−α_t)·(1−α'_t), an x_0-coefficient √α_{t-1}(1−α'_t)/(1−α_t), and an x_t-coefficient √α'_t(1−α_{t-1})/(1−α_t). Plug the candidate σ into (★) and read off its variance σ², its x_t-coefficient k_t/√(1−α_t), and its x_0-coefficient √α_{t-1} − k_t√α_t/√(1−α_t). On the same toy schedule:

  t=3: var ddpm 0.375000 vs q_σ 0.375000; x_t-coeff 0.395285 vs 0.395285; x_0-coeff 0.530330 vs 0.530330.
  t=2: var ddpm 0.150000 vs q_σ 0.150000; x_t-coeff 0.316228 vs 0.316228; x_0-coeff 0.670820 vs 0.670820.

All three numbers match to six digits at both steps. So the ancestral sampler really is the σ = this-value member; the old model is one point in the family, and at that σ the forward process is Markovian again. Good — that claim survives the check.

The endpoint I actually want is the opposite extreme: σ_t = 0 for all t. Then the random-noise term in (◇) disappears entirely:

  x_{t-1} = √α_{t-1}·( (x_t − √(1−α_t) ε_θ(x_t)) / √α_t )  +  √(1 − α_{t-1})·ε_θ(x_t).

No randomness injected anywhere (down to a vanishing supporting noise at t=1). x_0 is now a *deterministic* function of x_T. Before I read meaning into this, a quick consistency check that the σ=0 step is still a member of the marginal-preserving family — i.e. that it lands on q(x_{t-1}|x_0) when fed a draw from q(x_t|x_0). With an oracle network (ε_θ = ε), f_θ = x_0 exactly, and the step becomes x_{t-1} = √α_{t-1}x_0 + √(1−α_{t-1})ε reusing the *same* ε that produced x_t — which is, by definition, a draw from the t−1 marginal. Simulating it on the toy schedule (x_0=1.7): x_2 mean 1.202/var 0.498, x_1 mean 1.521/var 0.200, x_0 mean 1.700/var 0.000 — the targets. So the deterministic endpoint preserves the marginals too; it is the σ→0 corner of the same family, not something outside it.

This deterministic process is an implicit generative model in the GAN/flow sense: samples are a fixed pushforward of the latent x_T through a deterministic procedure. That single change buys three things at once. The terminal noise x_T is now a real latent code — fix it and you get one reproducible image — so I can interpolate two images by interpolating their x_T (spherically, since these are high-dimensional Gaussian samples), and I can hope to *encode* a real image by running the procedure backward. None of that is possible when every step injects fresh noise, because then the same x_T fans out to many different images and x_T carries almost no information about the result.

But the reason I started all this was speed, and determinism alone does not shorten the chain — (◇) at σ=0 is still written for all T steps. So now use the marginal-only fact a second time, more aggressively. The loss depends on the inference process only through the marginals q(x_t|x_0). Nothing forces the generative process to visit *every* t. I can define the whole construction on a *sub-sequence* τ = (τ_1 < τ_2 < … < τ_S) of [1..T], reusing (★) with the index pairs (τ_i, τ_{i-1}) in place of (t, t−1). The marginal-consistency check still applies for those indices — the induction only ever used the marginals at the two endpoints of a step, so it does not care whether the steps are adjacent integers or jumps. And the J_σ = L_γ + C argument still goes through on the sub-sequence (the leftover indices not in τ enter only as star-graph terms in the objective, never in the sampler). So I should be able to train at T = 1000 and *sample* on S ≪ T steps with the same network and no retraining. The per-step update on the trajectory is just (◇) with τ-indices:

  x_{τ_{i-1}} = √α_{τ_{i-1}}·( (x_{τ_i} − √(1−α_{τ_i}) ε_θ(x_{τ_i})) / √α_{τ_i} )  +  √(1 − α_{τ_{i-1}} − σ_{τ_i}²)·ε_θ(x_{τ_i})  +  σ_{τ_i} ε.

This is the candidate cure for the wall clock: S = 20 or 50 instead of 1000. But "skipping steps still returns the same image" is exactly the kind of thing I should run rather than believe. So let me trace the actual sampler code on a controlled input. Build an oracle network whose ε_θ(x_t,t) recovers the true noise for a planted x_0 = 2.0, run the deterministic (η=0) sampler on three trajectories of very different length over an 8-level schedule, and check what comes out:

  seq = [7]              (one jump from the top level)  → final x_0 estimate 2.000000
  seq = [0,2,4,7]        (four steps)                   → final x_0 estimate 2.000000
  seq = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7](full grid)                    → final x_0 estimate 2.000000

With a perfect noise predictor the deterministic sampler returns x_0 exactly regardless of how many steps it takes — even a single jump from the top level. That is the strongest version of the consistency property, on the real code path, and it confirms the sub-sequence construction does what I wanted: fewer steps, same target. (With a real, imperfect ε_θ the few-step result will not be pixel-identical, but the structure that makes it work — every step is a marginal-preserving move toward the same predicted x_0 — is what the trace just exercised.) The headache I thought was structural was an artifact of identifying the generative chain length with the forward chain length, and that identification was never in the loss.

Why should deterministic sampling, in particular, be the safer few-step choice? With σ_t > 0 every step injects fresh noise; on a short trajectory there are too few remaining denoising steps to average that perturbation back down, so stochastic error can remain visible. The larger the per-step σ, the more I ask the short chain to clean up. The σ = 0 process has no injected noise to clean up, so cutting steps only coarsens an otherwise smooth map rather than leaving residual noise behind. To slide between the two regimes cleanly, write σ_{τ_i}(η) = η·√((1−α_{τ_{i-1}})/(1−α_{τ_i}))·√(1 − α_{τ_i}/α_{τ_{i-1}}) with a single dial η ≥ 0: η = 1 is the stochastic ancestral endpoint for that trajectory (and on the full adjacent grid it is exactly the σ-value I checked above against DDPM, recovering the original ancestral sampler); η = 0 is the deterministic one, and intermediate η interpolates.

There is one more thing worth pinning down about the deterministic limit, because it might tell me how to discretize well. Take the σ = 0 update with a small step — adjacent levels t and t−Δt — and divide (◇) through by √α_{t-1}:

  x_{t-Δt}/√α_{t-Δt} = x_t/√α_t + ( √((1−α_{t-Δt})/α_{t-Δt}) − √((1−α_t)/α_t) )·ε_θ(x_t).

This is begging for a change of variables. Let x̄ = x/√α and σ = √((1−α)/α). Then α = 1/(1+σ²) and x = x̄/√(σ²+1), and the update reads

  x̄(t−Δt) = x̄(t) + ( σ(t−Δt) − σ(t) )·ε_θ( x̄(t)/√(σ²+1) ).

Divide by −Δt and send Δt → 0:

  dx̄/dt = (dσ/dt)·ε_θ( x̄/√(σ²+1) ),   i.e.   dx̄ = ε_θ( x̄/√(σ²+1) ) dσ.

So the deterministic sampler is an Euler integration of an ODE, with σ as the integration variable. In the rescaled coordinate the noisy endpoint is x̄(T) ∼ N(0, σ(T)²I) at large σ(T), while the sampler's stored latent x_T = x̄(T)/√(1+σ(T)²) is approximately N(0,I) at the α ≈ 0 end. That is consistent with the code trace: the generated image is the ODE's solution from the initial condition x̄(T), and the number of sampling steps is just the fineness of the Euler grid — which is why the same x_T gave the same x_0 at S = 1, 4, and 8 under an oracle, and why, with a real network, the high-level content should be fixed by the ODE trajectory while only fine detail moves with the discretization. It also suggests the encoding direction: run the ODE the other way, from t = 0 up to T, to deterministically map x_0 to its latent x_T; decode by running back. That is the same practical handle a flow gives — a reversible numerical trajectory whose reconstruction error should shrink as I refine the grid. I have not verified the encode-then-decode round trip numerically here; I expect it to close as the grid refines, and that is what I would test next on the real model.

And there is a sanity check I can run on this ODE against the score-matching world. The optimal ε_θ is the minimizer of E‖ε_θ(x_t) − ε‖² where x_t = √α_t x_0 + √(1−α_t)ε; by denoising score matching, predicting the added noise is, up to a known scale, predicting the score of the noised data. Concretely the σ(t)-perturbed score satisfies ∇_{x̄} log p_t = −ε_θ(x̄/√(σ²+1))/σ. The continuous score-based view samples by the probability-flow ODE dx̄ = −½ g(t)² ∇_{x̄} log p_t dt with g(t)² = dσ²/dt. Substitute the score:

  dx̄ = −½ (dσ²/dt)·( −ε_θ(x̄/√(σ²+1))/σ ) dt = ½ (dσ²/dt)/σ · ε_θ dt = (dσ/dt)·ε_θ dt = ε_θ dσ,

since ½(dσ²/dt)/σ = (σ dσ/dt)/σ = dσ/dt. Identical ODE. So the deterministic sampler is the probability-flow ODE of the variance-exploding diffusion, reached from a purely variational starting point with no Langevin or SDE machinery — which is reassuring, and also clarifies that the two are the *same ODE* but *different discretizations*: I take Euler steps in dσ, the score-based Euler step is in dt, and they coincide only as the levels get close. In few steps, stepping in dσ — which does not hinge on the arbitrary parameterization of "time" — should be the better-behaved discretization.

One more thing to test whether the contribution is the marginal-preserving non-Markovian construction and not anything Gaussian-specific. Replace the Gaussian marginal by a categorical one for one-hot data: q(x_t|x_0) = Cat(α_t x_0 + (1−α_t)1_K) with 1_K the uniform vector. The same backward construction gives a mixture reverse conditional q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = Cat(σ_t x_t + (α_{t-1} − σ_t α_t) x_0 + ((1−α_{t-1}) − (1−α_t)σ_t) 1_K), with σ_t chosen so all three mixture weights are nonnegative. Marginalizing x_t gives σ_t[α_t x_0 + (1−α_t)1_K] + (α_{t-1}−σ_tα_t)x_0 + ((1−α_{t-1})−(1−α_t)σ_t)1_K = α_{t-1}x_0 + (1−α_{t-1})1_K — the coefficients on x_0 cancel to α_{t-1} and the uniform terms collect to 1−α_{t-1}, pinned exactly as in the Gaussian case — and as the uniform coefficient goes to zero the step becomes a choice between copying x_t and using the predicted x_0 instead of drawing from the uniform background. The generative process replaces x_0 by f_θ; each objective term is a KL between two categoricals, and by convexity it is upper-bounded by (α_{t-1} − σ_t α_t)·KL(Cat(x_0)‖Cat(f_θ)), a plain multi-class classification loss whose weighting changes with σ but whose classification target does not. Same skeleton, no Gaussian needed: the construction is the marginal-preserving family, the Gaussian case is one instance.

So the picture closes, and every load-bearing step has been checked rather than asserted: training never constrained the joint, only the marginals and (with unshared per-t parameters) only up to reweighting; the marginal-preserving non-Markovian family (★) exists and keeps the marginals (induction verified analytically and by simulation); its variational objective is L_γ for *positive* γ (λ_t² > 0 confirmed over the σ-range) and therefore shares the unweighted ε-MSE optimum already trained; the special σ-value reproduces the ancestral sampler to six digits, so the old model is one member; the σ = 0 member is a deterministic implicit model whose update is (◇) without the noise term, and it too preserves the marginals; that update is an Euler step of an ODE in σ that coincides with the probability-flow ODE; and because the objective is indifferent to forward chain length, the same update on a short sub-sequence τ returns the same target under an oracle even from a single jump — turning a thousand sequential passes into twenty without retraining. Now the code. It is the generative `sample` slot, filled in: build a trajectory τ, walk it in reverse, and at each step form the predicted x_0, the direction term, and the (η-scaled) noise, exactly as in (◇).
