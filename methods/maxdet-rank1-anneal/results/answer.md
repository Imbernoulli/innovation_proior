**Problem.** Construct a single `29 × 29` `±1` matrix maximizing `|det|`, scored as
`|det| / (2^28 · 7^12 · 342)`. Because `29 ≡ 1 (mod 4)` the Hadamard bound is unreachable and the
true maximum is open (record multiplier `320`, Barba ceiling `369.94`). Simulated annealing on
single-entry flips reaches multiplier `~150` but is bound by per-flip cost: scoring each candidate
with a full `slogdet` (`O(n³)`) limits it to tens of thousands of flips from one seed, plateauing
short of the frontier.

**Key idea.** Score flips for free by carrying the inverse. A single-entry flip at `(i, j)` is a
rank-one update `M ← M + Δ e_i e_jᵀ` with `Δ = −2 M_{ij}`, so by the matrix determinant lemma the
determinant ratio is `1 + Δ·(M⁻¹)_{ji}` — `O(1)` to evaluate from a stored inverse, no
factorization. On an *accepted* flip, refresh the inverse with Sherman–Morrison, `M⁻¹ ← M⁻¹ −
(Δ/(1+Δ(M⁻¹)_{ji}))·(M⁻¹e_i)(e_jᵀM⁻¹)`, `O(n²)`, paid only when a move is taken. Scoring drops
from `O(n³)` per candidate to `O(1)`, so the same annealing on `log|ratio|` can run two-plus orders
of magnitude longer. Spend the freed budget two ways: `1.5M` flips per chain (room for the long
lateral sequences coordinated gains need), and restarts from several multiplier-relabeled
Jacobsthal seeds (`i ↦ k·i mod 29` for units `k` — distinct structured basins, same baseline). Keep
the global best; recompute its determinant exactly with Bareiss.

**Why these choices.** The annealing rung proved the search works and named cost as the limiter;
the matrix determinant lemma removes that cost exactly, with no change to the search dynamics. The
matrix stays exactly `±1` (entries land back on `∓1`), so only the carried inverse can drift, and
the float inverse is never trusted for the answer — the reported determinant is exact integer
arithmetic on a genuine sign matrix (periodic refactorization is the safety valve if the order
grows). Multiplier-relabeled restarts are free diversity now that compute is the abundant resource.

**Honest ceiling.** This reaches the band of the best machine-discovered results for `n = 29`
(multiplier `~197`, score `~0.576`); it does **not** reach the classical record (multiplier `320`,
score `0.9357`, Solomon 2002 / Orrick), which comes from dedicated Gram-matrix search of a
different kind and is only conjectured optimal. No program-evolution system has matched the record;
the gap above this method is the still-open part of the problem.

**Hyperparameters / contract.** `log`-temperature `0.06 → 2e-4` geometric; `1.5M` flips per chain;
seeds `k ∈ {1,2,3,6,10,12,15}` (`10.5M` flips total); fixed RNG per chain. Output `±1` by
construction; exact Bareiss determinant reported. Measured: multiplier `184.60`, score `0.53977`
(per-seed bests `k=1:172.6, k=2:177.1, k=3:181.8, k=6:170.9, k=10:184.6, k=12:175.6, k=15:172.4`;
global best from `k=10`).
