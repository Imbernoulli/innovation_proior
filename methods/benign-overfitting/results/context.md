# Context: when can an exact fit to noisy data still predict well?

## Research question

Classical statistical learning theory rests on a trade-off: a prediction rule that fits the training
data too closely will track the noise and generalize poorly. The textbook corollary, stated bluntly in
*The Elements of Statistical Learning* (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman 2001, p. 37 and p. 221), is that an
estimate that interpolates every training example is "unlikely to predict future data well at all" and
that "a model with zero training error is overfit to the training data and will typically generalize
poorly." Yet modern overparameterized models are routinely trained to *interpolate* — to drive training
error to exactly zero — and they predict well anyway, even when the labels are corrupted with noise.

The question this raises, in its sharpest and simplest form, is: in linear regression with squared loss,
when the parameter dimension is large enough that a perfect fit to the data is forced, can a rule that
fits the noisy training labels *exactly* still compete in prediction accuracy with the best possible
linear rule θ\*? If interpolation embeds all of the label noise into the parameter estimate, when does
that noise *not* corrupt prediction? A satisfying answer must be a finite-sample characterization — an
"if and only if" on the data distribution — not just an asymptotic curve, and it must say *which*
properties of the covariance of the covariates decide the matter. The goal is to find the exact dividing
line between overfitting that is harmless and overfitting that is fatal.

## Background

**The interpolation phenomenon.** The motivating empirical fact comes from deep learning. Zhang, Bengio,
Hardt, Recht and Vinyals (2017), "Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization,"
showed that standard image-classification networks and stochastic gradient methods, run until they
*perfectly fit* the training set, give respectable test accuracy — and crucially that this persists
*even when significant label noise is injected*. The networks reach essentially zero training loss yet
generalize. This directly contradicts the classical reading of interpolation as overfitting and is the
phenomenon any theory must explain.

**Double descent.** Belkin, Hsu, Ma and Mandal (2018), "Reconciling modern machine learning practice and
the bias-variance trade-off," organized the observation into a curve. Below the interpolation threshold
(model capacity < n) test risk follows the classical U-shape; *at* the threshold (capacity = n) it spikes;
*beyond* it — in the overparameterized, interpolating regime — test risk *descends again*, sometimes below
the classical sweet spot. This "double descent" is observed across model classes and datasets. It is an
empirical pattern with a posited mechanism but no closed-form risk and no statement of which problems
exhibit it.

**The minimum-norm interpolant and ridge regression.** When p > n there are infinitely many θ with
Xθ = y. The canonical choice is the smallest-norm one, which is the ridgeless (λ→0) limit of ridge
regression. Ridge regression estimates θ̂_λ = (X^⊤X + nλI)^{-1}X^⊤ y; as λ→0 with p > n this converges
to θ̂ = X^⊤(XX^⊤)^{-1} y, the pseudoinverse solution of the normal equations. So the object of study is a
classical estimator pushed into a regime where classical theory was never meant to apply: zero explicit
regularization, more parameters than samples.

**Classical bias–variance.** For squared loss the excess risk of any estimate decomposes into a term
driven by the systematic error in estimating θ\* (bias) and a term driven by the label noise propagating
through the estimator (variance). In a well-specified low-dimensional regression the variance grows with
the number of parameters fit, which is the classical reason interpolation is feared. The interpolating
regime overturns this only if the variance term can somehow stay small while p ≫ n.

**Effective rank.** A covariance operator Σ with eigenvalues λ_1 ≥ λ_2 ≥ ⋯ has a notion of effective
dimension that is gentler than the raw rank. Koltchinskii and Lounici (2017) use r(Σ) = tr(Σ)/‖Σ‖ — the
"effective rank" — to control how well the sample covariance (1/n)X^⊤X concentrates around Σ; the relevant
fact is that ‖Σ − (1/n)X^⊤X‖ is small once r(Σ) is small compared to n. Closely related quantities, the
"stable rank" tr(Σ²)/‖Σ²‖ (Rudelson–Vershynin), measure how spread-out a spectrum is. These are the tools
that let one reason about high- or infinite-dimensional covariances without a bound on the ambient
dimension.

**Concentration toolkit.** The analysis lives on the behavior of weighted sums of outer products of
independent subgaussian vectors. The load-bearing facts are Bernstein's inequality for subexponential
sums, the fact that the square of a unit-variance subgaussian is subexponential, and an ε-net argument
bounding the operator norm of a random symmetric matrix by its values on a net of the sphere (all standard,
e.g. Vershynin, *High-Dimensional Probability*, 2018). The Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula lets one peel
a single rank-one term off a Gram matrix and is the algebraic engine for isolating the contribution of one
direction.

**Contemporary analyses of the same estimator.** Hastie, Montanari, Rosset and Tibshirani (2019),
"Surprises in high-dimensional ridgeless least squares interpolation," study exactly the min-ℓ₂-norm
interpolant under x_i = Σ^{1/2}z_i, but in the proportional asymptotic regime p ≍ n with p/n → γ and the
empirical spectral distribution of Σ converging to a fixed measure; random matrix theory then yields the
asymptotic prediction-risk curve, recovering double descent. Belkin, Hsu and Xu (2019), "Two models of
double descent for weak features," compute the excess risk for specific linear models (identity covariance,
sparse θ\*, random Fourier features). Muthukumar, Vodrahalli and Sahai (2019), "Harmless interpolation of
noisy data in regression," analyze when interpolation of noise is harmless in related linear settings.
These are concurrent points in the same landscape: they describe behavior for particular Σ or in a
particular asymptotic ratio, but none gives a finite-sample two-sided bound for *arbitrary* Σ and
arbitrary dimension.

## Baselines

**Min-norm least squares.** θ̂ = X^⊤(XX^⊤)^{-1}y, equivalently
arg min{‖θ‖ : X^⊤Xθ = X^⊤y}. Core idea: among interpolants, pick the least-norm one (implicit
regularization toward small parameters). Math: by the projection theorem this solves the normal equations
with the pseudoinverse; with p > n and the data spanning generic directions it interpolates, Xθ̂ = y. The
open question it leaves: *no* characterization of when its prediction error is near-optimal — classical
analysis predicts disaster (variance ∝ parameters), which is wrong in the overparameterized regime.

**Ridge regression.** θ̂_λ = (X^⊤X + nλI)^{-1}X^⊤y with λ > 0. Core idea: shrink toward zero to control
variance; the ridge penalty trades a little bias for a large reduction in variance, and the optimal λ
implements the classical bias-variance sweet spot. Gap: the theory is built around choosing λ > 0; it says
nothing about the λ → 0 (interpolating) limit when p > n, and indeed the conventional intuition is that
λ → 0 is the worst case. Whether the *zero-regularization* limit can be near-optimal is exactly what is
unexplained.

**Double-descent description (Belkin et al. 2018).** Core idea/curve: test risk vs capacity is U-shaped
then peaks at the interpolation threshold then descends again. Gap: it is an empirical curve with a
qualitative mechanism; it does not predict, for a given data distribution, whether the second descent
reaches near-optimal risk, nor what property of Σ controls it.

**Proportional-asymptotics ridgeless analysis (Hastie et al. 2019).** Core idea: under p/n → γ and a
fixed limiting spectral measure of Σ, random matrix theory gives the exact asymptotic risk, including the
double-descent peak and the role of the noise level. Gap: it is asymptotic in a fixed ratio with a fixed
spectral shape; it is not a finite-sample statement, does not cover infinite-dimensional or
dimension-growing-faster-than-n regimes, and is one-sided in the sense of describing a limit rather than
bracketing the risk for every Σ.

**Norm-based generalization bounds for interpolators.** A line of work (e.g. Liang–Rakhlin 2018 on
kernel "ridgeless" regression; the kernel-interpolation studies of Belkin–Ma–Mandal 2018 and
Belkin–Rakhlin–Tsybakov 2018) shows particular interpolating rules can generalize, often via data-dependent
quantities of the empirical kernel matrix. Gap: these are existence/sufficiency results for specific
kernels or constructions; they do not give a tight, distribution-level necessary-and-sufficient condition
in terms of the covariance spectrum.

## Evaluation settings

The natural yardstick is the **excess prediction risk** R(θ̂) = E_{x,y}[(y − x^⊤θ̂)² − (y − x^⊤θ\*)²] of an
estimator relative to the optimal linear predictor θ\*, in a well-specified linear model
y = x^⊤θ\* + ε with E[ε | x] = 0. The covariate model is x = VΛ^{1/2}z, the spectral factorization of
Σ = VΛV^⊤ applied to a vector z of independent subgaussian unit-variance coordinates; the noise ε is
conditionally subgaussian with variance bounded below by σ². The regime of interest is overparameterized:
the parameter space (a separable Hilbert space ℍ, possibly infinite-dimensional) has effective dimension
exceeding n so that exact interpolation Xθ̂ = y holds almost surely. Performance is read off as a function
of the covariance spectrum {λ_i} and the sample size n, with both the infinite-dimensional fixed-Σ case
and the large-but-finite-dimensional case (dimension growing faster than n) in scope. A characterization
is judged by whether it brackets R(θ̂) with matching upper and lower bounds for *arbitrary* Σ and *finite*
n, and recovers the qualitative phenomena (harmless interpolation, the harmful p ≈ n case) as special
cases.

## Code framework

At the starting point, the available scaffold is a generic least-squares / ridge harness over a covariance
with a prescribed spectrum, plus empty slots for choosing an interpolating estimator and deriving a spectral
risk predictor.

```python
import numpy as np

    p = len(Sigma_eigs)
    Z = rng.standard_normal((n, p))                 # independent unit-variance coords
    X = Z * np.sqrt(Sigma_eigs)[None, :]            # x_i = Lambda^{1/2} z_i (V = I WLOG)
    eps = noise_sigma * rng.standard_normal(n)
    y = X @ theta_star + eps
    return X, y

def ridge_fit(X, y, lam):
    """Known baseline: ridge regression for lam > 0."""
    n, p = X.shape
    return np.linalg.solve(X.T @ X + n * lam * np.eye(p), X.T @ y)

def excess_risk(theta_hat, theta_star, Sigma_eigs):
    """Excess risk R = (theta* - theta_hat)^T Sigma (theta* - theta_hat). Known once theta_hat is fixed."""
    d = theta_star - theta_hat
    return float(d @ (Sigma_eigs * d))
